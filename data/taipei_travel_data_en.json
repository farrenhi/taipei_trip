        "open_status": 1,
        "introduction": "Established in 1952, the Grand Hotel is a 14-story palatial building towering on the hillside of Yuanshan and surrounded by Keelung River in the front, Mt. Yangmingshan in the back, Songshan to the east and Tamsui to the west. With its signature red columns and golden roof, the hotel&rsquo;s magnificent exterior presents a sumptuously classic ambiance that reflects the beauty of traditional Chinese arts. The hotel is one of Taipei City&rsquo;s world-renowned landmarks, and also the premium choice for travel accommodation or business conferences for people worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the Grand Hotel comes from its stately Chinese-style structures and splendid classic setting; the mystique of the hotel lies in its legendary, historic significance and the rumor about a secret underground passageway; one can chalk the hotel&rsquo;s otherworldly serenity to its great location, adjacent to a scenic belt away from the urban bustle.\r\n\r\nThe century-old golden dragons\r\nThe bronze dragons were initially desgined statues guarding the entrance to Taiwan Jinjia (built in 1901 in the style of a Japanese Shinto shrine). They were carefully preserved during re-constructions of the Grand Hotel, to be later perfectly displayed in the hotel&rsquo;s Gold Dragon Restaurant; the dragons were accentuated with 24-karat gold plating as part of the hotel&rsquo;s renovation efforts in 1987. It is worth noting that these dragons have three claws only, compared to the four or five claws on dragons depicted in traditional Chinese paintings.\r\n\r\nPlum-flower caisson ceiling\r\nOn the center of the hotel lobby&rsquo;s ceiling is a plum blossom-shaped caisson, with five golden dragons encircling a pearl, suggesting the &ldquo;Five Blessings.&rdquo; Inspired by the Chinese pronunciation of &ldquo;3&rdquo; sounding like &ldquo;rise&rdquo; and the number 16 plus the large plum blossom, the 23 golden dragons and 16 phoenixes in the caisson were deliberately designed to signify rising to prominence and continuous profits, respectively. The caisson ceiling is also a profound traditional symbol of prosperity, represented by the dragons and phoenixes.\r\n\r\nUpturned eaves and bucket arch\r\nOn the rooftop, both the upturned eaves and bucket arch embody ancient Chinese culture. While a row of animals crouch above the vertical ridge of the dramatically upturned eaves, the Chiwei, or monster-like ornaments made from roofing shingles, are poised between the main ridge and vertical ridge. The sumptuously delicate yet robust bucket arch structure under the roof is one of the greatest wonders in Chinese architecture.\r\n\r\nGlass doors of the hotel lobby\r\nThe gigantic, yet gracefully symmetrical, floor-to-ceiling glass doors of the lobby serve as the front entrance of The Grand Hotel. Look closely, and you will see six ancient Chinese characters signifying &ldquo;Long Live the Republic of China&rdquo;, hidden under the decorative patterns. The creativity of the design and how times have changed are surely impressive, considering the historical background of the hotel.\r\n\r\nStone tablet\r\nErected at the beginning of a stone staircase leading to the arched entrance is a giant stone tablet inscribed with the cursive-style characters &ldquo;Jian-Tan-Sheng-Ji&rdquo;. After verification from various sources, the words depicted in the free-flowing and powerful calligraphic work of the late politician Yu You-ren, are believed to mean that the Yuanshan area is sanctified, which offers an explanation for the Grand Hotel remaining popular and revered over the past century.",

The best preserved area is located at Mingquan Street, Heping Street, Renai Street and Chongshan Road. The old road sign of Sanjiayong Street at the corner of Mingquan Street is still there to evoke people&lsquo;s memory of a bygone age. The old street has been a pivot of commercial activities since the Qing dynasty as the distribution center of many commodities and raw materials. This area was transformed into a neat, dazzling place after an overhaul during the Japanese rule. In previous years, Sanxia Old Street was packed with stores selling tea, dyed cloth and camphor. The glory of this town was manifested by many examples of architecture built in a western style during this period. The 260 meter-long old street area on Mingquan Street has over 100 antique houses, which make Sanxia a great destination for people who want to see archways in Baroque style, innovative traditional craftsmanship, and a busy business area from over 100 years ago. Sanxia Old Street these days is as busy as in its golden age. When you walk in the red-brick arcade, you can see old stores named after family names, which was a common practice in the past. Stores selling cold drinks, calligraphy brushes, sweets, antiques, old-fashioned toys, furniture and snacks, all have a historic look, unlike their counterparts in other tourist destinations. Sanxia has a lot of gourmet food, including Jinnujia which is a kind of bread that gives out a strong fragrant smell and A-Laibo soy pudding which has an unforgettably smooth texture made by mountain spring water. Hengxi Q Chinese meatball next door is also a good choice because its special texture of stuffing with bird eggs. All the snacks sold in Sanxia Old Streets are worth trying because they are delicious but at reasonable prices.",

This sumptuously decorated, two-story Chinoiserie structure was completed in 1971 to mark the 60th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. Located at the geological center of Yangmingshan National Park, this building offers a spectacular view of the Taipei Basin in the distance. A pond in front of the building, observable from the second-floor veranda, is children&rsquo;s favorite as they are allowed to feed the varicolored carp in it. Adding quaint and solemnly elegant appeal to Gaungfu Building are exquisite carvings, paintings and numerous other typical Chinese architectural details that subtly made references to literature classics. When the flowers are in full bloom, the building becomes an island in a sea of cherry blossom petals. So just indulge yourself in this phenomenon by lingering around the circuitous corridors while appreciating the interplay between blossoms and the elusive mountain mist.",

This distinctive structure is located in the lush green environs of Beitou Hot Spring Park, near the Beitou Hot Spring Museum.\r\n\r\nThis library was the first building in Taiwan to receive the certification of &ldquo;Green Building&rdquo;. The structure makes generous use of French windows and natural light, and blends in with the surrounding environment. Built mainly of wood and steel, it resembles a large treehouse just waiting to welcome visitors.\r\n\r\nBeitou Library is &ldquo;green&rdquo; from inside to outside! Part of the roof is covered in solar panels, which can store up to 16KW of power. The wooden balcony railing is also eco-friendly; its vertical design conserves energy by reducing the amount of heat-causing rays allowed to enter the rooms. Rainwater collected by the sloping roof&rsquo;s drainage system is used to water the library&rsquo;s plants and flush the toilets. Eco-friendly paint was also used, to reduce the amount of toxins released into the environment.\r\n\r\nWhen you come to Beitou, besides having a nice soak in the hot springs, you can also visit the Beitou Library for some &ldquo;forest bathing&rdquo;&mdash;enjoying a good book surrounded by lush greenery, that is!",

Born in Tainan City in 1921, she learned the basics of dancing from Ishii Baku, the Japanese &ldquo;father of modern dance&rdquo;, before committing herself to introducing modern dance into Taiwan. She was revered as &ldquo; the mother of Taiwanese modern dance&rdquo; because of her 500-odd productions that cover genres ranging from ballet to folk dances of all ethnicities; the productions she helped inspired include: &ldquo;The Song of India&rdquo; and &ldquo;We Love Our Taiwan&rdquo;. The historic structure of Tsai Jui-yueh Dance Research Institute was one of the tens of dormitories for Japanese colonial officials built around 1925 on Zhongshan N. Rd. and downtown Taipei; they were mostly wooden, Japanese-style duplexes. In 1953, Tsai purchased this former residence of a Japanese &ldquo;Haninkan&rdquo; official, with part of the house designated for choreographic rehearsals. She went on to convert it into a dance studio. In 1999, scholars insisted that Tsai&rsquo;s dance studio, once destroyed in a fire and coveted by real estate developers, should be restored as a historic site in homage to Taiwanese modern dance.",

        "introduction": "Gengliao Historic Trail is one of the five historic trails that links Nangang to Shengkeng and Shiding. It is well-preserved and still in use. This trail is not only a shortcut to Shanzhuku and Tukuqiu, but it also leads to some ancient relics. Today, the trail is paved with granite, and despite its renovation, it still has a touch of archaic ambiance.\r\n\r\nStarting point of Gengliao Historic Trail\r\nThe ancient &ldquo;Pan&rsquo;s Family House&rdquo; is the only house in Nangang that still possesses bullet holes from war, and is still inhabited. Eight generations of the Pan family have lived here, meaning that the house is at least 160 years old, as old as the trail!\r\nOn the way to Laoliao Historic Trail, the Shihui Mine Tunnel is a remnant of our forefathers&rsquo; exploration. The remnant of Wei Jingshi Residence recalls the origin of the once prosperous tea industry here, despite the current sadness reflected by its remaining walls. Other places such as Tujiao House, Zheng&rsquo;s family graveyard and the mere 30cm tall Land Deity Temple are all evidence of the ancient history of this trail.\r\n\r\nRediscovering the Home of Tea\r\nThe history of tea development can be traced back two hundred years. During the rule of Emperor Qianlong, this place was an important production center of camphor and tea. Wang Shuijing and Wei Jingshi researched and developed the Wenshan-style Paochong tea and Nangang-style Paochong tea, respectively. Together, they ushered in the golden era of Nangang tea, and its fame spread far and wide.\r\n\r\nLaoliao Historic Trail was a tea road that tea merchants and villagers took 110 years ago.The name &ldquo;Laoliao&rdquo; was derived later based on the homonymy of the sounds. Gengliao Historic Rail, on the other hand, was used by night watchers (gengfu) in the Qing Dynasty on patrol, and during the Japanese occupation era, the trail served as a transport channel for tea between Shengkeng and Nangang.",

        "introduction": "After Taiwan&rsquo;s return to Chinese rule, the Taihoku Sugar Refinery was included in an industrial zone in line with a mixed-use urban development policy dating back to the Japanese colonial period. The refinery was then used by Taiwan Sugar Corporation (Taisugar) for warehousing, with small-and-mid factories such as chemical engineering plants and food processors thriving on the idle sugar-making space. Following the cluster of printing houses formed in the 1950s around the present-day headquarters of China Times, which took over the Taisugar warehouses, the expanded rail transport services sent clothing wholesalers mushrooming in the 1970s and 1980s. Dali Street had been a production center in Taipei until the urban planning authorities shifted their focus to the City&rsquo;s east end amid the changing industrial pattern. The once prosperous &ldquo;Huei-xia-vei&rdquo; neighborhood and industrial landscape at the rear of the refinery were marginalized due to a deteriorating quality of life, a high density of population and buildings, and the lack of public amenities. In a protest against a nursery project, the Dali Street residents were granted a park project to preserve Taiwan&rsquo;s farthest north-lying sugar-making facility, the main structure of which is a warehouse featuring red-brick masonry, arched gates, trapezoidal columns and a large-span framework. On Sept. 23, 2003, it was proclaimed as the 106th city-designated historic site.\r\n&nbsp;",

This scenic park with a classical style has attracted many wedding photographers coming here to capture shots of the new couples. Northeast of the lake is the park monument; to the north is a children&rsquo;s playground as well as a new basement car park built by the Parking Management Office. It is hoped that the public can enjoy more parking space and better service. In the park, there are trees like melaleuca, banyan tree, maple tree, alstonia scholaris, lagerstroemia, floss-silk tree, bauhinia, cherry blossom and coconut. With the shade provided by these trees, as well as the stone tables and chairs provided by the public for the people to rest; the park has attracted more people coming here to exercise and kick back in leisure. The public has also taken the initiative in maintaining the cleanliness and space of this recreational space. Whenever the golden evening sun shines on the entire park, it gives the impression that one is immersed in a rustic rural countryside. If you come here at the right time, you will enjoy these moments of peace&hellip; the tranquility begins here. The park is well recommended for its convenient location and accessibility, and a comfortable distance from the bustling crowd.",

        "introduction": "The Pingding Ancient Canal and New Pingding Canal in Pingdeng Village are reminiscent of the village&rsquo;s previous name of &ldquo;Pingding&rdquo;. Both canals were built more than 150 years ago to serve three purposes: transportation, irrigation and drinking-water supply. The Pingdeng Villagers remain highly dependent on these historic canals for their household water supply.\r\n\r\nOld Pingding Canal Trail\r\nThe hiking trail starts from Lane 95 of Pingjing Street, Pingdeng Village, with its up-and down-hill stretches covered by moss. The first sight that greets hikers along the trail is Qingfeng Pavilion, and located near the canal entrance is a bright-red inscription saying &ldquo;Old Pingding Canal&rdquo; with a brief history of the canal provided. The hiking trail runs parallel to the canal until reaching a cave at the end of waterway. It offers a glimpse of an adverse waterfront aquatic ecosystem along the way.\r\n\r\nEcological phenomena along Old Pingding Canal Trail\r\nThe Old Pingding Canal Trail is located approximately 300-500 meters above sea level in Pingdeng Village, Shilin District, on a plateau sloping toward the south. A combination of meandering Neishuangxi River, Neiliao River, hills and creeks, the trail area is a cradle for various species of vegetation, mostly Giant Elephant Ears (Alocasia macrorrhizos), Red Nanmu (Machilus thunbergii), Chinese Soap Berry (Sapindus mukorossii), Kadsura Pepper (Piper kadsura) and bamboo. Boasting an aquatic ecosystem that nurtures insects and reptiles of all kinds, the trail ensures a surprise-packed hiking experience.\r\n&nbsp;",

At first, it was a small hut, which was renovated within 10 years of its establishment. The splendid main body of the temple was built in 1961. Every year from September 17th to 19th of the lunar calendar, also the memorial day of Buddha&rsquo;s renunciation, the temple holds a big festival in celebration.

Some of its architecture has been preserved and some of Lin&rsquo;s family members still live here.

It has always been a summer resort in northern Taiwan. Every summer, a good number of tourists would gather here to swim and enjoy the sun. Fulong Beach was famous during the Japnaese occupation of Taiwan. 24 hectares in area, Fulong Beach faces the Pacific Ocean and has special golden sand. It is the most famous beach in northern Taiwan, just as Kengting is the most famous beach in southern Taiwan. In addition, the plants and ecological environment near the Shuangxi River are educational for the visitors.Fulong has long been the most popular swimming beach on the Northeast Coast. In addition to the open beach, the calm and sheltered water of the Shuangxi River, which empties into the ocean here, makes this an ideal spot for wind surfing, canoeing, and other non-powered boating activities. The large sandy beach itself is perfect for swimming, sun-bathing, and other beach recreation. The red-roofed, white-walled headquarters building of the northeast Coast National Scenic Area is located near the entrance to Fulung Beach. Next to the headquarters is a Visitor Center with exhibits, video briefings, and other information on the rich variety of natural and cultural resources on the Northeast Coast. Fulong Beach is currently under the management of the Taiwan Pineapple Co. Various types of equipment are available for rent, including kickboards, inflatable swimming rings, and four-person rubber boats. A variety of other water and beach activities are offered for a fee.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[source: Tourism Bureau, Republic of China (Taiwan)]",

After careful planning by the Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs, the center was finally opened to provide a home for the preservation of puppetry culture. Located near the Living Mall, the center presents its traditional subject matter in a thoroughly modern setting.

        "introduction": "Be Engaged: enjoy art and touch life\r\n\r\nLife is art and each person an artist. Taipei Performing Arts Center is about everyone and for everyone. It is a bridge between people and art. It touches the life of people in many ways.\r\n\r\nStage productions, workshops, talks, courses, tours; we have a wide range of programs and activities for all ages. As well as happening in the Center&rsquo;s theaters, performances are taken to new and unexpected places including Taipei&rsquo;s streets, galleries and museums, places wherepassers-by may have surprise, even unrehearsed, encounters with artists. All are guaranteed to give a good time and long-lasting memories.\r\n\r\nBe Open: encouraging creativity and networking the world\r\n\r\nTaipei Performing Arts Center is open to all possibilities. It&rsquo;s a place where all artists can play and experiment with their imagination, enabling their talent to blossom. It offers many resources, including technical support, for artists of all kinds, curators and producers. Cross-disciplinary exchange is encouraged.\r\n\r\nTaipei Performing Arts Center actively participates in local and global performing arts communities. It strives to bring together local and international curators, producers andvenues, and welcomes cross-national productions. It is a departure point for Taiwanese performing arts to travel the world, for welcoming the world&rsquo;s artists to Taiwan, and a hub for collaboration between them.\r\n\r\nBe Bold: let imagination play\r\n\r\nTaipei Performing Arts Center stands out from the crowd. Located near Jiantan MRT Station and Shilin Night Market, Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Rem Koolhaas&rsquo; contemporary-looking building features a cube-sphere main body with block-shaped structures extending in three directions. It&rsquo;s an imaginative and multi-purpose design that reflects the liveliness and open-mindedness of Taipei, and the vibrant energy of its people. Koolhaas&rsquo; geometric design forms a dialogue between the real and the surreal. The whole structure is lifted up from the ground, the sphere looking like a planet is floating in the air. At street-level is a vibrant public space open to all. The scene is completed with the hustle and bustle of nearby streets; a nonstop live drama day and night.\r\n\r\nTaipei Performing Arts Center has a &ldquo;3+1&rdquo; configuration with effective use made of every space. The 1,500-seat Grand Theater and 800-seat Multiform Theater can be used independently or combined into a 2,300-seat Super Theater. In addition, there&rsquo;s an 800-seat Proscenium Playhouse that features an unusual spherical auditorium. Visitors may also follow the Public Loop that connects the three theaters and allows them to see backstage: the equipment, rehearsal spaces, all the internal workings of a theater. Taipei Performing Arts Center is the first theater in Taiwan to offer such a tour, which must end with the scenic view of Shilin from the outdoor viewing deck.\r\n\r\n(Source&nbsp;From : Taipei Performing Arts Center)",

As the zoo is home to more than 400 animal species, rest assured there&rsquo;s plenty to see!\r\n\r\nThe zoo includes 7 indoor exhibits, each with different themes.At the Insectarium you&rsquo;ll meet several butterfly species unique to Taiwan. Next, you won&rsquo;t want to miss the hugely popular Koala House and Penguin House. There are also two giant pandas from China! These animals are the Zoo&rsquo;s resident celebrities, so be sure to check them out!\r\n\r\nThe star of the zoo used to be the Asian Elephant &ldquo;Grandpa Lin Wang,&rdquo; who lived to the ripe old age of 86. Lin&rsquo;s longevity&mdash;20 years older than most Asian Elephants&mdash;was hailed by zoologists as a miracle. After his death, Lin was stuffed and put on display, and now enjoys the distinction of being the world&rsquo;s largest stuffed Asian Elephant! You can see him on display in the Education Center.\r\n\r\nApart from the indoor exhibits, the Taipei Zoo also features 8 outdoor exhibit areas. The latter are divided according to geographical environment, and possess educational value both as exhibits and ecological environments. The &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Zoo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Formosan Animal Area,&rdquo; and &ldquo;African Animal Area&rdquo; are the most popular, according to Internet voting. The Formosan Animal Area includes endemic species like Formosan sika deer, Taiwan macaque, and Swinhoe&rsquo;s pheasant. These animals can only be found in Taiwan&mdash;definitely worth a look!",

The gondola ride includes four stops, namely the Taipei Zoo Station, Taipei Zoo South Station, Zhinan Temple Station, and the Maokong Station. It is very easy to ride the Maokong Gondola; after getting off the last stop of the Metro&#39;s Wenhu Line&mdash;Taipei Zoo Station&mdash;walk to the Maokong Gondola&#39;s Taipei Zoo Station to take the gondola.\r\n\r\nThe three most beautiful times to take the gondola are in the midst after rain, when the sun is setting, and when the lights of the city are shining at night. As the gondola passes over the undulating terrain, you can glimpse moving Metro trains, the park along the Jingmei River, and the &quot;giraffe&quot; incinerator. When you reach the second stop, the gondola takes a big turn, and you will get a panoramic view of the landscape, including vehicles moving along the freeway below. After passing the Zhinan Temple Station, you will enter a steep V-shaped gully; this is the climax of the gondola ride, and is an unforgettable experience.\r\n\r\nThe final stop is at Maokong, where numerous tea plantations and tea shops are located. Many visitors specially make the trip here to have tea and chat. Make sure to visit a tea shop and order the famous &ldquo;Muzha Tieguanyin&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wenshan Pouchong tea&rdquo; when you visit Maokong. The trip will be worth your while when you taste the delicious specialty tea and meal combo, and view the stunning scenery of Taipei Basin.&nbsp;",

        "introduction": "In seeking tranquility for the mind and soul, and in hopes of spiritual guidance, the early settlers in Wenshan District transported Qingshui, a Chinese deity from their hometown, Anxi, and built a temple to enshrine it at the confluence point of Xindian River and Jingmei River, an area that was called the &ldquo;Xizaikou&rdquo;. &ldquo;Wanqingyan&rdquo; was completed in 1831 (the 11th year of Emperor Daoguang&rsquo;s reign). Qingshui was named Chen Zhao (Yin) in Henan during the Song Dynasty. He was said to have helped alleviate drought in Anxi with his fervent prayers, the locals persuaded him to stay. He then stayed at Qingxi (today&rsquo;s Anxi, Fujian) and practiced Buddhism for 19 years before attaining enlightenment, and was deified after death. He became one of the important deities in the Anxi region, and is also known by other names: Ancestor, Black-faced Ancestor, Dipped-nose Ancestor, Immortal Qingshui and Master Mazhang.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGiven its proximity to Jingmei River, &ldquo;Wanqingyan&rdquo; was susceptible to floods. Having also experienced multiple road demolition works, it was relocated to the current site at long last, inside the levee, after its reconstruction. At present, in addition to the three statues of the god being treasures of the temple, there are important historical artifacts, such as the century old plaque with the inscription &ldquo;Kai Men Gan Lu&rdquo; (Open the door to receive sacred sweet dew) and the stone made &ldquo;Wanqingyan&rdquo; censer with &ldquo;the 18th year of Emperor Daoguang&rsquo;s reign&rdquo; (year 1836) inscription. In early times, people used the stone censer as a whetstone, resulting in an obvious arc-shaped dent on its appearance. There is a cultural gallery set up beside the temple displaying photographs of the Jingmei area in the olden days. It is definitely worth your visit for a closer look.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

After losing an ethnic clash (i.e., Ding-Xia-Jiao-Ping) in 1853, immigrants from Fujian&rsquo;s Tongan region were forced out of Bangka by the Sanyi immigrants, also from Fujian, to settle in Dadaocheng. As the trade input between China and the West reached a record high, Dadaocheng replaced the inaccessible Bangka as a major port and prosperous business district.\r\n\r\nStores selling goods from China mushroomed along Dihua Street, which is situated behind the riverfront-facing Guide Street. Overnight, wealth prompted the Dihua Street-based businessmen to erect opulent houses with arcades adapted to the rainy climate. In addition to the intriguing eclectic facades that are decorated in Western style, these old storefront houses are best known for being extremely narrow and deep. Behind each storefront is a factory or a warehouse, lending an air of distinction to this cluster of old-fashioned housing complex.",

        "introduction": "The Youth Park is an open space park in the Taipei metropolitan area, located in the west of Wanhua District. Surrounded by Guoxing Road on the east, Qingnian Road on the west, Shuiyuan Road on the south and Qingnian Road on the north, the Park covers an area of 24.44 hectares. It was originally a military training site during the Japanese Occupation and was later converted into an airport. As it is located in the south of the City and stands opposite to Songshan Airport at the north, it was thus known as the South Airport. In 1953, Taipei Country Club, together with the Ministry of National Defense, founded Taipei Golf Club at the site. On 1974&rsquo;s Youth Day, the Executive Yuan ordered the Taipei City Government to take over the golf course, which then converted it into the Youth Park. In October of the same year, the management was officially passed over to the Taipei City Government, and the reconstruction was completed in September 1977, providing a recreational place for Taipei residents.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Park is surrounded by flowers and trees; it has beautiful sceneries and comprehensive sports facilities. Chargeable sports facilities include: 1 golf course near Guoxing Road, 8 swimming pools near Shuiyuan Road, 6 tennis courts to the south of the Park, and a billiard hall within the swimming complex. Free sports and recreational facilities including: basketball courts, badminton courts, baseball court, skating rink, tennis practice walls and outdoor sports complex can be found in various parts of the Park. There are also social educational facilities like the plant nursery, reading room, audio-visual room, outdoor amphitheater and police post, to serve the residents and tourists. Besides the various infrastructures, the Park&rsquo;s landscape planning, green facilities and plants are the main attractions in beautifying the Park. At the Park&rsquo;s entrance, the radial-shaped flowerbeds are planted with beautiful, colorful flowers (such as: garden balsam, cockscomb, scarlet sage, Mexican heather, spider flower, golden dewdrop, etc.). At the back of the flowerbeds are shrubs and flowers, such as: azalea, Graber&#39;s Pyracantha, garden croton, Kusamaki, Ixora, etc. Visitors will feel like they are entering a flower show, and will be mesmerized by the magnificent colors.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt the center of the Park is a vast lawn, and surrounding this manicured and green field are banyan trees that form a dense green tunnel. Overlooked from afar, it looks like a sea of greenery, as if one is having a forest bath when wandering within it, which refreshes one physically and mentally. The sides of the lawn are grown with needle-leaved trees (hoop pine), which attract many morning exercisers. At the back of the lawn is a waterway that connects to the zigzagged bridge at the eastern-north of the Park. The side of the waterway is planted with aquatic plants, and there are fountains everywhere, making it a pleasant scenic landscape. Towards the east of the baseball court are maple trees, and as these trees mature, they form a maple forest. When the maple leaves fall, it creates a beautiful autumn-winter scene. The Park area is also planted with azaleas, and when they blossom in spring, the bright colors make the Park even more glamorous. Bushes, shrubs and lawns, decorated with flowerbeds, garden chairs, pavilions, foot massage paths, sculptures, and flat, broad walk paths, make it is an excellent example of a large-scale comprehensive park.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Youth Park is spacious and has a large variety of facilities, providing the public with recreational, sports, social educational and rehabilitation facilities, enjoyed by young and old, the disabled and healthy people. To maintain the beauty of a park, besides cherishing its beautiful landscape, it requires the support and care of the public when enjoying the fruits of the construction work of the City Government.",

It also &nbsp;caused private and public property losses, totaling 10 trillion yen. On July 10th of that same year, the newly restructured Taipei City Fire Department set about building Taiwan&rsquo;s first fire safety museum and arming it with simulation features, in order to raise awareness about natural crises and the correct approaches to tackling them.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEmploying computerized, electronic or mechanical simulations, the museum now offers quasi-physical experiences of various natural hazards &mdash; along with thorough mini-documentaries on their respective histories and characteristics &mdash; in the hope that visitors will make preparations accordingly for fires, floods, earthquakes, typhoons and other types of calamity part of their daily life. Fun tips are also incorporated into the exhibits to help visitors brace for the unexpected more efficiently.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn conveying what they have learned from those educational displays to friends and families, the museum-goers can spread the message and help to effectively avert the threat of disasters.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKeep in mind:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n(1) All visitors will be charged an admission fee. To ensure high-quality services, however, please follow the museum guides&rsquo; instructions.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n(2) Interactive displays are available ONLY to visitors aged 4 or older.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

The principle deity here is Guansheng Dijun. The Beitou Branch is commonly known as Zhongyi Temple due to its proximity to the former Zhongyi Railway Station and Zhongyi MRT Station today.\r\n\r\nThis grand temple covers an area of about 8.0 hectares. The facilities include a library, lushly planted grounds, trails, landscaped courtyards, rest pavilions, a parking lot and public restrooms. The Zhongyi Trail head is also located here for visitors wishing to explore the scenic natural surroundings.",

The overall decoration lacks complexity, yet fineness can be found in its simple, understated beauty. The architectural design of the building was deeply influenced by the classical European style. The first floor of the structure was built using heavy piling of stone materials laid to form an elegant arcade of four columns and three spaces, where the arches are composed of trapezoid Qili&rsquo;an rocks. Patterns pieced together by wood can be found in the arcade ceiling. The second floor and roof trusses are all made of wood, covered with pieces of asbestos tiles on the mansard roof. The outward appearance features steep roof and dormers on the fa&ccedil;ade, as well as stone arcade columns. It is an imitation of a Renaissance style building and is the only remaining detached western-style shop still extant today that was built during the Japanese Colonial Period.",

The Park was completed in 1974; the area open to visitors is about 2 hectares. It is a garden that was naturally landscaped.\r\n\r\nThe Park has flat terrain and is triangular shaped. Decorated with a style mimicking Chinese gardens, the Park presents natural scenery. A corridor is connected to the pavilions in the center of the pond, along with waterside pavilions, a stone cave, a nine-turn bridge, an artificial mountain, and a waterfall. Besides adhering to contemporary aesthetics, Shuanxi Park has also preserved the beauty of the past. For tranquility in a bustling neighborhood, this Park is definitely worth visiting.",

        "introduction": "Located at the junction of Section 1 of Zhicheng Road and Yusheng Street in Shilin District, beside Shuangxi River, this vast nature Park is thoughtfully installed with ecological features and culture-historical relics. The Park got its name because its landscape is similar to that of Zhishan in Fujian&rsquo;s Zhangzhou, whose people came to settle in northern Tamsui and Shilin during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty. Historical monuments abound in the Park, with prehistoric cultural icons, including those of the Dabenkeng, Zhishanyan, Yuanshan and Botanical Garden eras, as well as the enchanting history and culture of the Qing Dynasty, Japanese Colonial period and Nationalist government. There is a century-old temple &ldquo;Huiji Temple&rdquo; in the Park, which was built in the 17th year of Emperor Qianlong&rsquo;s reign in the Qing Dynasty. In 1979, the temple was designated as a Class 3 historical monument by the Ministry of the Interior, in which the main deity is Kai-Zhang-Sheng-Wang (Sacred Prince, Developer of Zhangzhou). Due to the fact that the Park is a well-preserved historical site, many ancient trees can be found here, including the icon of the Park, a 300-year-old Camphor tree grown next to the Yunong Reading Room. The extended weathering process has caused the landforms in the Park to figure various quaint sculptural formations, such as Elephant Rock, Cavity Rock, Onion Rock, Giant Rock and Snake Frog Rock, which are all excellent geological educational materials.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

        "introduction": "Commonly referred to as &ldquo;Bangka&nbsp;Dizang Temple,&rdquo; this Class-3 national historic monument, located on Xichang Street, Wanhua District, enshrines Ksitigarbha. It was unveiled in 1760 and remodeled in 1838 (the 25th year of Emperor Qianlong&rsquo;s and the 18th year of Emperor Daoguang&rsquo; reign, respectively) with its property management rights transferred to the neighboring Longshan Temple to avoid confiscation by Japanese colonists.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSitting on a west-east-facing lot, Dizang Temple was designed in the one-hall style of the mid-Qing period with its simple structure enhanced by unpretentious carvings, a 3-span fa&ccedil;ade, a &ldquo;swallowtail&rdquo; ridgeline, gable ends, a humpbacked rafter-and-purlin entrance corridor and round-based columns. Besides a wooden post-and-lintel framework comprising two crossbeams and three-guatong (melon-shaped short columns) &mdash; the crossbeams are connected by rafters from which lanterns are hanging &mdash; the main hall features a statue of Ksitigarbha, the chief deity whose birthday (30th of the 7th lunar month) is marked by a large-scale ritual celebration. Sitting at Ksitigarbha&rsquo;s left hand is Lord North Pole; sitting to his right-hand side are the Taipei Prefectural Chenghuang (city god) and Marshal Tiandu &mdash; who were relocated from Taipei&rsquo;s Prefectural Chenghuang Temple and Zilai Temple on Xiyuan Road, respectively, after Japanese colonists torn down their original places of enshrinement &mdash; alongside Generals Fan and Xie. The quaint censer on the offering table was, as its inscription indicates, presented in the autumn of 1899 (the 25th year of Guangxu era), 17 years after the temple plaque was installed above Ksitigarbha&rsquo;s throne, and 2 years before the old-school incense burner first appeared in front of Generals Fan&rsquo;s and Xie&rsquo;s figurines. Not far away from the Dizang Temple is a sanctuary erected in 1760 to commemorate the &ldquo;Lord of the Hordes,&rdquo; mostly homeless spirits of single Chinese settlers who died in Taiwan. The sanctuary&rsquo;s history is, to a great extent, intertwined with that of Dizang Temple.",

The terrain is high on the west and low on the east, and on its peak is a sundial for observing the movement of the sun. The path is paved with sandstone and shale. Hushan River passes through the mountain, and forms an excellent natural habitat for the nurturing of fireflies, frogs and diversified life forms, making this trail the best spot for observing a wetland natural habitat. Along the path are also clear indicators and maps. This is an ideal place for both hiking and ecological observation.\r\n\r\nSishou Mountain Citizen Forest\r\nThe Sishou Mountain Trail was renamed Sishou Mountain Citizen Forest after having undergone renovation. The forest includes four mountains: Hushan (tiger), Baoshan (leopard), Shishan (lion) and Xiangshan (elephant), and forms a natural environment for birds, making it an excellent venue for the general public for outdoor leisure activities.\r\n\r\nHushan River Ecological Trip\r\nHushan Highland 120\r\nWith the renovation work of Taipei City Government&rsquo;s Department of Economic Development, Hushan River has become a garden with abundant marine organisms. The public can enjoy fireflies, tree frogs and all sorts of animals and plants amidst the trees and water.\r\n\r\nHushan Highland 120\r\nHighland 120, famous for the great view and an old armory, is a highland park named after its altitude. The neat plantations and resting shelter serve as a great landmark for hikers to rest and chit-chat.\r\n&nbsp;",

        "introduction": "As the Chinese poet Liu Yuxi had famously contemplated, &ldquo;Mountains are prestigious for the presence of immortals, not for their height; seas are sacred for the inhabitance of dragons, not for their depth&rdquo;, the Songshan Cihui Temple in Taipei&rsquo;s Fushou Mountain was founded, and is currently operated, by Guo Ye-zi, a devoted and virtuous Taoist priestess who insists on a career of universal relief through a facility that educates, inspires and purifies its followers. In other words, the temple was constructed out of the founder&rsquo;s ultimate compassion that urged her to extend self-help to others. Dedicated to &ldquo;Wuji Yaochi Dasheng Xiwang Jinmu,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mother of the Infinite Jade Pond,&rdquo; this awe-inspiring, gracefully landscaped temple is nestled amid verdant hills to evoke religious sentiments. That explains why it is a mythical sanctuary for Taoist deities and immortals, a Mcca for Taoists seeking peace of mind, and an intriguing must-visit for tourists. Occupying an area of approximately 33,000 m2, the towering Cihui Temple comprises a group of elaborately structured, five-story buildings flanked by pagoda-style bell towers for an imposing and magnificent effect. The patio outside the temple&rsquo;s 2nd floor main hall commands a panoramic view of downtown Taipei, which is exciting and unforgettable enough to make you want to linger longer. Patterned after traditional Chinese temples, the main structure is a quaint mixture of the distinctive palatial arts from the Ming and Qing dynasties and modern architectural techniques, ingeniously accentuating the mountain area&rsquo;s luscious pine woods with its red bricks and yellow rooftops, in a dazzling manner, like a green cocktail garnished with a red cherry.",

By assembling tens of thousands of vertical pipes into an organic, towering structure of varying heights, the designers create a rippling phenomenon spanning the elevated space by constructing a multilayered, multi-perspective visual experience. This spectacular, gigantic light sculpture reinterprets Songshan&rsquo;s enthralling legacy, like flamboyant blossoms under a canopy of light. Bubbling with life, it is a garden of multiple delights that celebrates the sights and sounds of Songshan, which has evolved considerably and is coming into full bloom.",

Then, all kinds of vendors were attracted to the communities because a large number of people passed by. Little by little, the place continued to prosper. Finally, the lively South Airport Night Market was formed.\r\n\r\nThe night market is famous for various classic dishes of old Taipei.

Just a hectare in size, the Lilliputian park offers an outsized view of the scenic riverside area. This green oasis was created by the Taipei City Government with sand and earth dredged from the Keelung River. The park facilities include stone and wood-plank walkways leading to a viewing platform that has also become a favorite spot for local fishermen. The park offers an excellent 270-degree view of the river confluence and surrounding area, including Guandu Temple to the right, the dazzling red Guandu Bridge spanning the Tamsui River, and Guanyinshan to the left. The park is also a popular foraging spot for little egrets, adding further to the scenic portrait here. To the left of the viewing platform you can also see a lush mangrove wetland area, echoing the ecology at Guandu Nature Park on the opposite bank. If you arrive during the low tide, you can also see the fiddler crabs busily scuttling through the mangroves.",

Thus, a passenger can get access to a train, a high-speed rail, MRT Bannan Line and MRT Tamsui&ndash;Xinyi Line at the station.\r\n\r\nTaipei Main Station has been relocated and renovated numerous times since its establishment on July 5, 1891. The station building today was completed on September 2, 1989. It is also where the headquarters of Taiwan Railway Administration was set. As Taipei Metro and Taiwan High Speed Rail started operating, the Taipei City Mall, an extensive underground market, was gradually formed.\r\n\r\nThe whole area related to Taipei Main Station is as large as 46.31 hectares, including the nearby commercial district with businesses and learning institutions, Taipei Transit Station, MRT North Gate Station, Airport MRT Taipei Station, Huashan 1914 Creative Park and other places of the &quot;Taipei Station Specific Area.&quot; It is undoubtedly the biggest hub of transportation in the Taipei&ndash;Keelung metropolitan area.",

There is also the Yuanshan Reservoir sitting on higher ground, which is an important water conservancy stage of the Grass Mountain Waterway System.

After the firing range moved away, the site was converted to a strip-shaped Park built along the foot of Xianshan (Elephant Mountain). With shady trees, chirping birds and fragrant flowers, the Park has become a popular spot for morning joggers.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe noteworthy feature of the Park is that it is the only location in the City where tree frogs can be spotted. Taipei tree frog (Rhacophorus taipeianus) is a protected species endemic to Taiwan, with its size ranging between 3 and 5 cm and in different colours like yellow and green. It was discovered and named in 1978 by Prof Wang Chin-Jan of National Taiwan University. The tree frog sanctuary is located at the northeast corner of Zhongqiang Park. To provide tree frogs with a protected, sustainable habitat in Zhongqiang Park, Giant Elephant&rsquo;s Ear and Ginger Lily are planted, alongside native species such as Tuberous Sword Fern, Cretan Brake Fern, Chinese Taro, Common Tree Fern and Bird&rsquo;s Nest Fern; furthermore, a water pump was installed at the sanctuary to supply a fixed amount of water to the tree frog natural reserve, to preserve its wetland condition and thereby ensure habitat sustainability.",

        "introduction": "In the early days, the transportation in Muzha District was very inconvenient as the town was located in the inland of Taipei basin, impeding Christian missionary outreach. In 1875 (the 1st year of Emperor Guangxu&rsquo;s reign), Zhang Nai-Hong, a tea grower in Zhinan mountain area, went past Xindian area and met Professor Mackay (Rev. George Leslie Mackay), who was teaching the scriptures in the Bible&rsquo;s Matthew 11:28 &ldquo;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; Zhang was no stranger to extremely heavy cargoes, so the scripture left quite a strong impression. He began to believe in the Lord and went to church with his wife on Sundays since then on. Afterwards, Zhang became an elder in Xindian Church in 1878. As the journey to Xindian Church is long, Zhang set up &ldquo;Neihu Church&rdquo; (a branch of Xindian Church) in August 1891 at the ferry of Zhinan village (near Duxian Bridge of National Chengchi University). In 1897 (the Japanese colonial period in the Meiji era), Zhang and others &nbsp;spent 30 dollars on the current estate, on which the the church was built, and named &ldquo;Muzha Church.&rdquo; Construction was completed on April 30th of the following year.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt was elevated to an official church on April 17, 1954. However, due to factional dispute, another group of believers set up &ldquo;Xinxing Church&rdquo; at a location less than 50 meters away on the same street. In 1962, with the effort of Taipei Presbytery of The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, the two churches merged into one, which was named &ldquo;Bunsan Church&rdquo;. Reconstruction of the new church, currently known as the old church, was launched on April 22nd of the same year. Nevertheless, the church could not accommodate the expanding congregation. Hence the construction of another new church, which began on March 13, 1994 and the dedication service was completed on April 12, 1998 after a series of challenges. Opposite the church is the starting point of the Muzha Old Street; its current address is No. 27, Kaiyuan St. In the past, it was a midway destination for the travelling traders, but now it is just a general store. Its tilted roof and wooden window frames, however, still tell the stories of its former glory.&nbsp;",

This mostly Hinoki-wood house was built in 1931 as Professor Adachi Masashi&rsquo;s residence. It is a cross between Japanese and European architecture, with the left half including the reception room, study and dining room, featuring European-style details such as bookcases, glass bay windows, an outdoor flower bed and a porch, while the bedrooms and children&rsquo;s room in the right half are covered with traditional Japanese Tatami mats. The house was taken over in 1945 by Ma Ting-ying, a professor of geology from NTU who befriended Adachi, and it officially became a city-designated historic site in 2006. In 2011, several NTU alumni rented the house from its governing body, the NTU, and the site has since been open to the public free of charge for guided tours and popular science activities. The living room, dining room and study were converted into a caf&eacute; that also sells cultural and creative items as souvenirs.",

        "introduction": "Inspired by a project commissioned to the Taiwan Textile Federation, the Fashion Institute of Taipei was co-founded by Taipei City&rsquo;s Department of Cultural Affairs and the Industrial Development Bureau, MOEA, in an attempt to create a platform of information exchanges concerning fashion design. The institute plans to give designers access to a database of designers/apparel manufacturers and incubator-oriented training programs, among other resources and assistance, in order to encourage collaboration between fashion designers and companies. It also serves as a liaison between fast pattern-making centers and designers, so the latter may focus on cultivating their expertise as creative designers and front-end workers in the fashion industry.\r\n\r\nA tree-inspired interior design\r\nA cradle of competent Taiwanese fashion designers\r\nThe Fashion Institute of Taipei, located in the culturally significant Bangka area (a.k.a. &ldquo;BangKa&rdquo;) and previously known as the Taipei Costume Cultural Center, is a 3-story emerging fashion landmark with the Bangka (or Dali) Fashion District being its hinterland.\r\nDriven by the vision of &ldquo;a tree of creativity&rdquo;, the institute matches its brick-red exterior with an interior designed to resemble a tree nourished by Wanhua&rsquo;s historical and cultural influences, which would hopefully foster local designers who give back to Bangka&rsquo;s clothing business in the manner of decomposed foliage sustaining the soil. The institute vows to help its resident designers secure demonstration contracts with apparel firms from across the Bangka Shopping District, and eventually build worldwide reputation for the country&rsquo;s original fashion brands and design prowess.\r\n\r\nCollaborating with academic institutes to nurture emerging designers is also a priority for the Fashion Institute of Taipei. In addition to guided tours for faculty members and students in areas pertaining to fashion or apparel, the institute launches summer internship programs to give students a sense of how a design project is linked to marketing efforts, other than acquiring an insight into the country&rsquo;s ready-to-wear sector, through active involvement in Bangka&rsquo;s clothing business operations and designer-corporate partnerships. Also available for local talent are analytical programs about the latest clothing trends, or professional fashion shows.\r\n\r\nAn inspiration-packed facility\r\nA resident designer program for maximum creativity\r\nDecorated with a color scheme centered on pure white, the ground-floor lobby is a space that offers fashion information while catering to all five senses, as evident in a catwalk stage for designers&rsquo; lovely projects and a caf&eacute; in the cozy corner, where visitors seek inspiration while sipping coffee and browsing through stylish clothes or glossy design-related publications.\r\n\r\nFor greater efficiency, exciting films are played on interactive LCD screens (controlled using a device similar to Wii) on the ground floor to offer details about the Fashion Institute of Taipei, the cultural and historical aspect of Bangka, or the resident designers, including their styles and portfolios.\r\n\r\nThe second floor is converted into a mobile work platform for designers, with personal studios closed to the public on weekdays. To encourage designers to push the envelope and present art museum-worthy clothes, this creativity-charged space comprises a pattern-making section where all fabrics are available for free. The institute is seeking additions to its list of the current five resident designers (Norah Hsu, Wei-xiang Zeng, Andre Kao, Xue-Zheng Lu and Yu-Lin Shih) through annual auditions aimed at scouting out fresh designers with the potential of shining in the international fashion industry.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd floor, an area suitable for moderate-scale fashion shows, exhibitions, performances and lectures, is thickly carpeted and upholstered for soundproofing. For further diversified and flexible use of rooms, the ceiling rails, arranged to resemble the map of Bangka, are combined with movable partitions to offer designers just the right amount of space. The exhibition and performance facility, complete with backstage dressing rooms for models, are available for rent by fashion design majors for training courses or fashion shows.",

The Chen family&rsquo;s ancestors came from Anxi County, Quanzhoufu of Fujian Province. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the early Chen members traveled to Taiwan as pioneers. It wasn&rsquo;t until the early Guangxu era that they invested a huge sum of money to construct the Yifangju Estate. This traditional sanheyuan (a three-section compound) was typical of the ancient residences of the Taipei basin area. The main hall was constructed in a U-shape design; the walls of the main hall and ancillary halls (to the left and right of the main hall) were built with bricks, and few windows and doors were present. In addition, a firearms cabinet was built on the second floor of the ancillary halls to guard the residence against robbers. Furthermore, most of the window frames were made with rocks produced in Taipei. The door plate of the residence indicated that it was constructed around the 2nd year of Emperor Guangxu. Due to the rapid modernization of Taipei City, traditional residences like Yifangju Estate continue to dwindle in number. It is important that those that remain are preserved as testimony of Taipei&rsquo;s development history.",

They chose this area for its moist mountain climate, which was well suited for growing tea. They also brought their local gods, including Baoyi Zunwang, Baoyi Dafu and Qingshui Zushi. At that time, the settlers came mainly from three clans: the Kaos, Changs and Lins. As their numbers grew, the wilderness receded to cultivated land extending from Jingmei to Muzha, Shenkeng and Shiding. The gods also joined in this migration with the establishment of three temples, one of which is the Jiying Temple at Jingmei Market, established by the Kao clan.\r\n\r\nLocated in the old part of Jingmei, Jiying Temple is designated as a grade three historic site. The temple is imposing both inside and out, with elaborate stone engravings, wooden window frames and other decorative touches adding to its old-world charm.",

Once the summer getaway home for the master of cursive calligraphy of the generation, Yu You-ren, it is now a municipal historic building. The Japanese timber framing-style architecture features a common RC air raid shelter used in the early stage of the Pacific War. The enclosing walls of the courtyard adopted a battlement structure. The backyard is tree-shaded, verdant and luxuriant, overlooking Beitou River with murmuring water, and on the pillar beside the entrance, you&rsquo;ll see the calligraphy inscription &ldquo;Plum Garden&rdquo; by Yu You-ren.\r\n\r\nThe Plum Garden is a Japanese residential building that witnessed the war era. It was built on a sloped terrain and has an upper and a lower floor. The upper floor faces Zhongshan Road. The fa&ccedil;ade, with Japanese timber framing, is on the ground floor level. Research on the construction work on the wall reveals that it is a moisture-proof partition mortar wall. The interior layer of the timber frames is troweled with red mud and sand, while the outside is decorated with white mortar. The building&rsquo;s external features a masoned base, fish scale sidings, black tiles, and wooden window lattices. The lower floor is built with reinforced concrete and is used as an air raid shelter; it leads straight to the backyard. The Japanese building structure and underground air raid shelter trench echo the large air raid shelter trench right across; its special meanings fills it with historic value.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n",

        "introduction": "To visit the open-air hot spring pools in Beitou Park, just walk from the parking entrance toward Thermal Valley, and they are only a 15-minute walk.\r\n\r\nThe park was only opened in late 1999, on the eve of the new millennium, and is therefore also known as the &quot;Millennium Hot Spring.&quot; The pools occupy roughly 1,000 square meters, and the area features a Japanese-style architectural design employing mostly natural materials such as stone and wood. The roof of the ticket booth and bathhouse consist of curved black tiles, which add to the classic Japanese atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe hot spring water in the park comes from Thermal Valley, and is derived from so-called green sulfur springs. The six public pools are located at different heights reflecting the sloping topography; four are hot pools, and two are cold pools. The temperature of the hot springs water varies between 38&deg;C and 42&deg;C, and decreases progressively as one goes downhill. This system allows bathers to select a hot spring pool with the temperature that suits them best.\r\n\r\nOne benefit of bathing in an outdoor pool is that you can enjoy the gentle breeze, the pleasant sounds of nature, and the park&#39;s lush greenery as you soak. If you choose to bathe at night, the bright moon and countless stars will accompany you as you soak away the weariness and stress of urban life.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that, in order to maintain the cleanliness and safety of the pools and the surrounding environment, visitors must wear swimsuits when bathing, and must uphold bathing rules. The pools are open for six periods every day, and first open at 5:30 in the morning. Please visit the park&#39;s website for detailed bathing hours and other relevant information.\r\n\r\nDo you enjoy outdoor hot springs bathing? Why not have a soak at the Beitou Park Outdoor Hot Spring Pool!",

Not only are the history of Taiwanese pastry and ceremonial traditions shown in an exhibit area, but the museum also offers hands-on baking experiences at the Joy Bakery and family-friendly events both in-and out-doors, in the hope that people of all ages will love and appreciate the art of Taiwanese pastry.\r\n&nbsp;",

Yangmingshan features a widely varying terrain, diverse ecology, and is home to numerous protected species. If you&rsquo;re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of one of Taiwan&rsquo;s endemic bird species&mdash;the Formosan Blue Magpie.\r\n\r\nThe park is full of plum, cherry, peach and pear trees, rhododendrons, etc. In spring, the cherry blossoms never fail to draw crowds. After cherry blossom season, about mid-March, it&rsquo;s time for the calla lilies at Bamboo Lake (Zhu-zi-hu) to take center stage. Visitors go into the fields and pick calla lillies to take home with them&mdash;it&rsquo;s become a must-do event for this time of a year!\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most distinctive features in the park is the &ldquo;Flower Clock,&rdquo; composed of a variety of colorful seasonal flowers. When visiting Yangmingshan, be sure to take a photo to prove you&rsquo;ve seen this famous landmark! Also worth checking are popular sights like the Hsiao-you-keng (&ldquo;Small Oil Pit&rdquo;), Ching-tien-kang (Qing-tian Hill) Leng-shui-keng (&ldquo;Cold Water Pit&rdquo;), and Yangming Archive House. If you enjoy an invigorating hike, these will be right up your alley!\r\n\r\nThe Yangmingshan area also possesses a wealth of geothermal resources, with hot springs having differing compositions depending on their location in the park. Nearby Xing-yi Road in Beitou is lined with hot spring restaurants. If you&rsquo;re passing along this way, don&rsquo;t forget to take a relaxing dip in the sulfur springs!\r\n\r\nBeautiful flowers in the spring, a cool getaway in the summer, silver grass and maple leaves in the fall, hot springs in the winter&mdash;Yangmingshan&rsquo;s distinctive seasonal offerings await your discovery!",

Originally known as Tianhou Temple, it was built in 1796 with funding from a local merchant named He Chin-tang at the site of the present-day Shilin Tourist Night Market. The temple was destroyed in a fire that engulfed Zhilan Street during a fight between rival immigrant clans from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in mainland China. Through the efforts of Pan Yung-ching, a member of the local gentry, the street was rebuilt at Xiashulin, known today as Shilin New Street. Cixian Temple was subsequently built at the center of this new street.\r\n\r\nCixian Temple consists of two halls, two galleries and two wings that together form five courtyards. The two halls are linked by a gallery in a style typical of southern Fujian temple architecture. The Sanchuan Hall in the front part of the temple is covered by a double-eaved gable and hip roof with a swallowtailed ridge in the style of a &quot;Taizi Tower&quot;. The central door to the main hall is flanked by octagonal columns carved with coiling dragons dating to the Guangxu period (1875 to 1908). The left and right carved kylins were made in 1828.

The name Xianjiyan is due to the large rock at the peak, which is believed to be the relic of an immortal (&quot;xian&quot;). It is a branch of the Nangang Mountains. At 144m in height, Xianjiyan offers a gentle day out for family groups. Many trails ascend the hill, the most popular being the stairway of the monumental archway starting from next to No. 241, Jinxin St (#3 entrance on the map). Though the steps are rather steep at the beginning, they become gentler. Trees are thick; the slope is gentle, making it a good choice for summer. The hill and Xianyan Temple make good sightseeing destinations, offering fine views.\r\n\r\nBuses 10, 30, 74, 209, 251, 253, 278, 284, 290 and 505 all come here; visitors should alight at the Jingxing Road stop.",

While walking along Royal Palm Boulevard with the green shade of both sides arching the sunrise, one experiences a feeling of heading on a broad and open road to a bright future. It is a very special sunrise attraction in the City. Near the College of Agriculture, there are many aquatic plants, vegetables, fruits and vanilla gardens. Some interesting observations of ecological restoration can also be made in the experimental farm. The alleys near the campus are surrounded by mainstream bookstores and smaller independent bookstores, as well as the coffee culture, transforming the NTU neighborhood with a strong cultural element.",

        "introduction": "Previously known as Park No. 12 located in the Wanhua District, the sprawling Bangka Park next to Longshan Temple is enclosed by Guangzhou St., Heping W. Rd., Sanshui St. and Xiyuan Rd. Developed by the Taipei City Government, it is a distinctively art-themed &ldquo;folklore park&rdquo; teeming with culturally significant details. For example, a dragon-inspired sculpture in the Park&rsquo;s east side is inspired by a Chinese Feng Shui rule for good luck, being an azure dragon appearing on the left-hand side when facing south, while a boat sculpture in the west side recount a bit of history of the early settlers in the neighborhood who used canoes as a common means of transportation, ferrying and trade. Adjacent to a pond named &ldquo;Beauty&rsquo;s Mirror&rdquo; is a viewing platform defined by Feng Shui principles in accordance with the position of the Big Dipper constellation, where illuminated &ldquo;dancing water&rdquo; shows are staged on a daily basis. After sunset, the Temple Gateway Square, an extension of the Longshan Temple into the Park&rsquo;s north side, sees over 2,000 stars simultaneously radiating lights of varying colors from an astrological chart that consists of both Chinese and Western zodiac signs. Meanwhile, the roof tile-like structure of reinforced glass and vitreous enamel panels transforms the Park&rsquo;s inverted U-shaped art gallery into a passageway with recreation and exhibition facilities. As an important public project in the City Government&rsquo;s campaign of &ldquo;Rotating the Axis of Urban Development and Regenerating Taipei West&rdquo;, Bangka Park, along with its neighboring Longshan Temple, will hopefully blossom into a vibrant international tourist hotspot of historical, cultural and religious importance that buttresses western Taipei&rsquo;s growth and business potential, and ultimately regains the glory of this two-century-old neighborhood.",

The sulfuric steam that blankets the valley year-round gives the valley a frightening quality, giving rise to nicknames like &ldquo;Ghost Lake.&rdquo; The springs here have the highest temperatures of any in the Datunshan volcano group. With its surreal sulfuric atmosphere, it&rsquo;s no wonder Thermal Valley was considered one of the &ldquo;12 great sights of Taiwan&rdquo; during the Period of Japanese Occupation!\r\n\r\nThe &ldquo;Beitou rocks&rdquo; (aka Hokutolite or Anglesobarite) in Thermal Valley contain the radioactive element radium. Out of the many thousands of minerals existing in the world, they are the only ones named after a place in Taiwan, and can be found in only two places: Beitou and Tamagawa, Japan. In recent years, the &ldquo;Beitou Rock Conservation Area&rdquo; has been established to ensure the protection of these natural rarities. Thus, when visiting Thermal Valley, you not only get to experience &ldquo;hell&rdquo; but also gain insight into some rare radioactive rocks!\r\n\r\nWater temperature in Thermal Valley&rsquo;s hot springs ranges from 80-100℃. The sodium carbonate springs tend to be corrosive, and have come to be known as &ldquo;Green sulfur springs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sulfur heads.&rdquo; Visitors used to boil eggs in the hot springs, but the practice has since been prohibited&mdash;not only to protect the water quality but to keep tourists from falling in and boiling themselves!",

It is situated behind the Grand Hotel and is also the hill nearest to the City center. The trail along the ridge will also lead to the other mountains. It is an easy and relaxing trail for hikers to take in the panoramic views of the city, and it is accessible via a variety of public transportation means.\r\n\r\nJiantan Mountain Trail\r\nThe entrance to the mountain is located at Sec. 4 of Zhongshan N. Rd. near MRT Jiantan Station. This was once a military control zone and also a conservation area; thus, its natural habitat and ecology are well preserved. In addition, numerous manually cultivated plants can be seen along the trail, enriching it with greenness and vitality.\r\n\r\nThis trail has become a popular venue for nearby residents doing their morning exercises. The &ldquo;Old Place&rdquo; for instance, is one of those famous &ldquo;exercise spots&rdquo;. Along the trail, one can see the Grand Hotel and Keelung Riverside Park. At the end of this easy-to-traverse trail you&rsquo;ll come out at Lane 165 of Tongbei Rd., near Beian Rd. intersection.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeautiful Night Scenes from Jiantan Mountain\r\nThe night scenery of Jiantan Mountain Trail has always been popular, and not without reason. Located at a high altitude in the midst of a bustling city, coupled with airplanes flying low across the night sky above, the ambience it generates always creates excitement and anticipation; the place has thus become a popular hangout for young couples and students. What adds to the allure, are the delicacies of Shilin Night Market, and it is no wonder that the trail has more hikers during the nighttime than daytime!\r\n&nbsp;",

        "introduction": "The South Gate, or &ldquo;Lizheng Gate&rdquo;, was completed in 1884 (the 10th year of Emperor Guangxu&#39;s reign) and boasts the most stately fa&ccedil;ade that befits the majestic main gate of Taipei City. Built with elaborately crafted stones from the suburban Dazhi area, the South Gate features a hornless dragon (chilong) motif that sets it apart from similar structures in the neighborhood. Having survived the Japanese colonialist offensives that ruined much of the city&rsquo;s protective structures, though, the South Gate, nevertheless, was starting to show signs of age. A Nationalist Government&rsquo;s attempt to restore its fa&ccedil;ade in the Northern Chinese palatial style totally changed its looks but, fortunately, preserved both the masonry foundation and round opening in the wall. Located beside the Class-1 historic site of Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau at the intersection of Gongyuan Rd., Nanchang St and Aiguo W. Rd., and due to its proximity to the President&rsquo;s Residence, the area is heavily guarded with &ldquo;plainclothes&rdquo; military policemen who can easily intimidate passersby, which is a shame. Next time when you walk by, don&rsquo;t forget to slow down and appreciate this beautiful gate that once defended Taipei City from harm.",

In 1967, Mr. Ch&rsquo;ien built this house in Waishuangxi and named it after the Wuxi (China) family estate where his mother lived. At the Ch&rsquo;ien Mu House, every detail of the garden, such as the footpath lined with maple trees and rows of bamboo, is a result of years of tireless horticultural efforts by Mrs. Ch&rsquo;ien.\r\n\r\nMr. Ch&rsquo;ien was constantly giving lectures in Taiwan and has attracted a loyal group of followers, including college professors, who have visited the Sushu Building for 20 consecutive years along with their students on outings. An empowering and charismatic speaker, Mr. Ch&rsquo;ien impressed his ever-packed audience with the amazing nuances of Chinese culture.\r\n\r\nA few months after moving out of his 22-year residence at age 96, Mr. Ch&rsquo;ien died; the Sushu Building was left untended for years until it was reopened on Jan. 6, 1992 by the Taipei Public Library as a memorial hall. It was then renovated by the city government in 2001. Taipei City&rsquo;s Department of Cultural Affairs renamed Sushu Building on Dec. 31, 2001 as &ldquo;The Ch&rsquo;ien Mu House&rdquo; and handed it over to Soochow University for management. It was succeeded by the Taipei Municipal University of Education on Jan. 1, 2011.",

        "introduction": "Previously known as the Zhongxing Guesthouse, the construction of Yangmingshuwu was completed between 1969 and 1970 to serve as a place where the late President Chiang Kai-shek received guests from around the world and spent his summer vacations. It was the only residence Chiang chose to build in Taiwan and became one of the culturally and historically significant buildings in the Yangmingshan National Park. Offering services ranging from travel information to guided tours, this recreational spot integrates nature and culture; sense and sensibility. The history of the Yangmingshuwu can be divided into the &ldquo;forest park&rdquo; period, the &ldquo;Zhongxing Guesthouse&rdquo; period, the &ldquo;Historical Commission of Kuomintang (KMT) Central Committee&rdquo; period and the &ldquo;national-park administration&rdquo; period.\r\n\r\nThe approximately 15-hectare site is located on Zhongxing Road, adjacent to the Flower Clock near Yangjin Highway and Dongsheng Road. Nestled in what was initially a primitive forest, the Yangmingshuwu is overseen by the Yangmingshan Administration; it once served as a campsite of the General Association of the Scouts of China. The Zhongxing Guesthouse and its appendix buildings were completed in 1970, with the forest remaining partially intact. After Chiang Kai-shek moved into the guesthouse, the neighboring area was heavily guarded for security reasons, hence the diversified eco-system in the academy&rsquo;s proximity and along Zhongxing Road.\r\n\r\nIn 1975, the Zhongxing Guesthouse was renamed as Yangmingshuwu (shuwu literally means &ldquo;document house&rdquo;) as it became the location of the Historical Commission of KMT Central Committee&rsquo;s office, as well as the collective storage place for historical documents previously kept in Caotun and Qingtan, and also for historical materials relating to Chiang Kai-shek from the Daxi Information Office and the Zhishanshuwu.\r\n\r\nOn Sep. 26, 1997, the Historical Commission of KMT Central Committee donated the aboveground structure and the administrative rights of Yangmingshuwu to the Ministry of the Interior, which in turn placed the Yangmingshan National Park in charge of the operations. With careful planning, the Yangmingshuwu was reopened to the public on Jun. 27, 1998, after the establishment of an administrative office. The Da-yi Hall was built to expand tourist services, followed by the Yangmingshuwu Visitor Center beginning to offer tourist information, videos, back-lit panels, scale model exhibits and guided tours on Sep. 11, 2000.",

They were built by Liu Ming-chuan during the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty as a measure to expedite urban development by encouraging businessmen to invest in or build houses/streets in Taipei City.\r\n\r\nAlso known as Cheng&rsquo;en Gate, the North Gate in erstwhile Taipei City served as a major gateway to Dadaocheng. The two-story fortress of North Gate is enclosed by sturdy walls in the form of a highly guarded citadel. For surveillance and defense reasons, the square- and round-shaped window openings on the front and back of fortress are the only two features on the second floor. Similar to the East Gate, the North Gate in its inception had a small enclosure on the outside, commonly referred to as &ldquo;urn city&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Wong Cheng&rdquo; in Chinese. There used to be a horizontal plaque saying &ldquo;The Key to Territory Safety&rdquo; which had hung across the gate. The plaque was unfortunately removed by Japanese colonial rulers and is now located on the empty lot in front of the North Gate for display.\r\n\r\nIn light of the emerging trend of cultural heritage preservation in recent years, the city authorities decided to abandon a demolition plan of the historic North Gate. Of the five ancient city gates, the North Gate is the only one that remains what it used to look like in the Qing Dynasty, as well as one of the most valuable state-designated historic sites in Taipei.",

Sec. 2, which is the shortest path of all three. Descending from the top, to a pass at 181m elevation, and then climbing again to another peak (with high voltage power tower) takes about 20 minutes. Here, a huge stone protrudes towards the north and, looking from Bishanyan, the mountain looks like a knife, which is the origin of the name Jiandaoshi Mountain. The whole of Taipei City can be seen from this peak.\r\n\r\nVisitors can take the buses No. 267, 247, 256, blue 27 alighting at Takming College and walk to the entrance of Lane 91, Neihu Road Sec. 1; or take the buses No. 256, 267, blue 27 alighting at Lishan village stop and walk to the entrance of Lane 50, Huanshan Road Sec. 2; or take the buses No. 220, 240, 256, blue 20 alighting at Xihu garden stop and walk to the entrance of Lane 24, Huanshan Road Sec. 3.",

        "introduction": "Tianmu Historic Trail\r\nThe Tianmu Historic Trail meanders through the northwestern slope of Shilin&rsquo;s Huagang area as well as the saddle to the south of Shamao Mountain. As the second half of the previous Yulu Historic Trail, the Tianmu Historic Trail comprises several footpaths that connect Huagang and Tianmu along a water main. These footpaths are perfect for a refreshing summer hike with the murmuring creek running through a pristine forest nearby. People who seek cool, tree-shaded trails may as well take the Cuifeng Trail and stop by Cuifeng Waterfall before reaching Houdong Industrial Road.\r\n\r\nOnce a major transportation corridor between Jinshan and Tianmu, the Tianmu Historic Trail has literally become an &ldquo;old trail&rdquo; since the inauguration of Yangde Blvd. and, in recent years, has been crowded with sightseers every weekend.\r\n\r\nEcological phenomena along the Tianmu Historic Trail\r\nAt an altitude of 300 to 120 meters, Tianmu Historic Trail features a broadleaf forest ecosystem typical of the low-altitude, subtropical Taiwan. Northeastern monsoons and the attendant gales, rainfall and low temperatures coming from the saddle of Datun Mountain helped to create a warm-temperate broadleaf forest along the trail on the windward hillside. The shady and humid valley on the leeward side, nevertheless, encourages the growth of tropical broadleaf trees and such tropical phenomena as the buttress roots, cauliflory, and Strangling plants. Although the trail is located only at 300 meters above sea level, it boasts a rarely-seen, compact ecosystem that simultaneously comprises broadleaf forests of tropical, subtropical and warm-temperate biomes.\r\n\r\n◎Warning for hikers: When you reach a fork in the path leading downward toward Cuifeng Waterfall, do NOT feed the monkeys that frequently show up in groups because they may hurt you while fighting for food!\r\n&nbsp;",

As the majority of the plants here are black pines and maples, they are thus the most representative plants of Taipei Aowanda. This is a must-visit attraction for maple lovers.",

Among the Confucius temples in Taiwan, Taipei&#39;s is the only one adorned with southern Fujian-style ceramic applique. At the main hall of the temple one can see a black plaque with gold lettering that reads &quot;Educate without Discrimination.&quot; Every year on September 28, a grand ceremony with traditional music and stylized dancing is held at the temple in honor of Confucius.",

Because the park was covered with grass, it was originally called &quot;Grass Mountain.&quot; After the Japanese era, in order to commemorate the Ming Dynasty scholar Wang Yangming, Grass Mountain was renamed Yangmingshan in 1950, and the Yangmingshan Administration was set up to develop the national park.\r\n\r\nYangming Park has an area of 107 hectares and is located mainly on Mt. Datun. With a height of 445 meters, the park is surrounded by Mt. Qixing in the rear, Mt. Shamao on the left, and Mt. Datun on the right. The park also has a great view of the ridges of distant Mt. Guanyin. The climate here is warm and humid, and thanks to relatively cool summer temperatures, the park is a perfect place to escape the heat. The park is the only natural place in Taiwan that possesses dormant volcanos, sulfur fumaroles, and hot springs.\r\n\r\nThe park is planted with plum, cherry, peach, azalea and camellia blossoms, and consistently attracts throngs of people to view the cherry blossoms every spring. There is also a flower clock that is assembled from various seasonal flowers. Do not forget to take a picture with this flower clock, which is the showpiece of Yangming Park, when you are here.\r\n\r\nIn Yangming Park, visitors can view the flowers in spring, escape the scorching heat in summer, watch the silvergrass flowers and colorful leaves in the fall, and soak in the hot springs in winter. Yangming Park offers different stunning views and enjoyment throughout the four seasons. Its wonders await your exploration.",

In 1901, Taiwan Governor&rsquo;s Office consolidated the Taiwan Pharmaceutical Factory, Taiwan Salt Bureau and Taiwan Camphor Bureau into the &ldquo;Monopoly Bureau of the Taiwan Governor&rsquo;s Office&rdquo;, marking an important beginning of the monopoly system. Before the Retrocession of Taiwan, the eight commodities included in the monopoly system were: tobacco, liquor, opium, salt, camphor, matches, petroleum and measuring instruments. The building was constructed in 1913 to cater to the voluminous workload of the monopoly system. It was designed by an engineer of the Construction and Maintenance Division of the Taiwan Governor Office, Matsunosuke Moriyama (1870 -1949) and was completed in 1922. The architectural style is similar to that of the Presidential Office, and it became the model structure that was copied after by other elites architectural projects at that time. The building features an L-shaped floor layout and there is a semi-circular gable at the facade. The foyer has a spherical roof top and the fa&ccedil;ade; both the right and left wings feature a column-style design, giving the exterior of the building a rich and grandiose look.\r\n\r\nAfter the Retrocession of Taiwan, the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Executive Office, in an effort to maintain its financial resources and minimize the taxpayers&rsquo; burden, decided to continue the monopoly system. The organization was restructured as &ldquo;the Taiwan Province Monopoly Bureau&rdquo;, with the number of monopolized items down to five: tobacco, liquor, camphor, matches and measuring instruments. By 1968, the two items that remained in the monopoly system were tobacco and liquor.",

Qingtiangang was designated by Japanese colonial rulers as the site of the Dalingzhi Ranch for tea-growing and cattle-herding purposes. After taking over Taiwan, the Chinese nationalist government established the Yangmingshan Ranch in the Qingtiangang /Lengshuikeng area, following the original Japanese tradition. Once Taipei City was placed under the administration of the Executive Yuan, the Taipei City Farmers&rsquo; Association became responsible for the ranch operations, with the cattle herds on Qingtiangang being owned by farmers in Beitou, Shilin and Jinshan. With gently rolling meadows and dazzling verdancy, the evenly surfaced Qingtiangang is a wonderful outdoor classroom for grassland observation, and the most popular hiking destination in Yangmingshan National Park, with a foot path impressively lined with undulating grass and stumpy shrubs.",

They were intended for professors&rsquo; dormitories, and nestled in a kind of lushness that was unique to academia.\r\n\r\nAfter relocating from mainland China in 1949, Dr. Yin Hai-Kwong taught philosophy at Taihoku Imperial University while contributing articles of political criticism to the Free China Journal. As a man who would rather die a critic than live muted, Dr. Yin was a warrior fighting with a pen despite the rigorous censorship. He stood up bravely against the then-authoritarian regime with unbridled political criticism, exerting a strong influence on Taiwan&rsquo;s progress toward democracy, as an iconic figure in the history of Chinese liberalism.\r\n\r\nThe residence is a one-story, Japanese-style wooden structure built on a triangular base, adjacent to the other dormitories. In May 2003, the Taipei City Government designated it as a historic site that housed a significant collection of cultural assets. The Dr. Yin Hai-Kwong Foundation in November 2008 took over the operation and maintenance of the residence, recently serving as a facility for NTU&rsquo;s outdoor education activities.",

        "introduction": "The vast stretch of sandbars and wetlands near Huajiang Bridge has long been a habitat for various migratory birds, attracting thousands of species of the Anatidae, Scolopacidae and Charadriidae families from September through April. The park is divided into a Core Zone, a Buffer Zone and a Sustainable Utilization Zone, according to the type of ecological resources, in an effort to preserve and protect the natural environment with the fauna/flora habitats intact. Inaccessible to the general public, the Core Zone is a major wetland restoration site largely dedicated to the restoration and maintenance of bird habitats. The educationally-functional Buffer Zone separates the Sustainable Utilization Zone and Core Zone with hedgerows or blockade ditches; it consists of freshwater ponds, tidal ponds, aquatic plants and marsh plants, each representing a distinctive eco-system. Growing among the artificially planned and cultivated park turfs are many herbaceous and woody plants that insects feed on, while the sizeable population of invertebrates on mudflats and shoals offer perfect food for Scolopacidae and Charadriidae. Primarily designed for family recreation and bird watchers, the Sustainable Utilization Zone is installed with a duck-watching trail, a bird observatory square and a family-friendly zone, where people can enjoy outdoor activities with relatively little environmental impact. To further promote ecological education, large-scale duck- and goose-watching events are hosted in the park during the migratory-bird season, with guided tours available on weekends/holidays. The Huajiang Wild Duck Nature Park, which lies beyond the embankment, and Huazhong Riverside Park, are perfect for wild bird watching; their comprehensive facilities ensure easy observation of the fascinating eco-systems.",

The keel-inspired bridge stretches from the Dragon Boat Rock in the east to Yuanjue Waterfall in the west, connecting four mountains (Baishihu, Daluntou, Zhongyong and Liyu) along the way as if it were a gigantic dragon watching over the scenic Baishihu.\r\n\r\nThe Baishihu Suspension Bridge features a straight abutment, rather than the towering ones commonly found at similar bridges, which gives it a cable-less and &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; style that blends perfectly with the idyllic surroundings. The Baishihu Community on the other side of the bridge boasts a 100-meter Chunqiu Footpath that greets visitors with an ingeniously and professionally engineered horticultural area, besides the unique scenic and ecological resources of farms that produce organic vegetables and strawberries.\r\n\r\nAreas around the suspension bridge, including the temple yards, orchards, forest footpath and the lake-strewn wetland, provide terrific places to enjoy blooming flowers and chirping birds. Art workshops and handicraft clinics are also hosted by community elders to pass on Baishihu&rsquo;s legacy\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

It has an area of approximately 8,413 square meters. The main feature of the Park is a 100-meter-long eco-waterway, which serves as a miniature of the creeks of Northern Taiwan. The downstream of the river ecological zone is a pond eco-park, with aquatic plants such as azolla, water lily, cattail, and yellow water lily. Abundant aquatic plants, such as saururaceae, ludwigia ovalis, etc., can also be found in the floodplain at the end of the eco-park. Walking in the park, one can see birds, amphibians, insects, etc., hear the croaking of frogs and water flow, and smell the fragrance from ginger lily, osmanthus, etc. Visitors can take a break from their busy life and stop to experience the beauty of nature.&nbsp;",

        "introduction": "Junjianyan is an ideal site for school field trips owing to its convenient location in Taipei&#39;s suburbs and its special geological and botanical features.\r\n\r\nPictureWith an elevation of just 185m and numerous easily accessible paths, Junjianyan is popular with hill walkers everyday. Ascending from in front of the Yangming University campus research building (about 800m away from MRT-Qilian station) takes around 30 minutes by means of a 500m-long stone stairway. A fork in the middle of this path offers the choice of paved and railed route to the right and natural sandstone to the left. The huge white rock on the top resembles a battleship, which is the origin of the name in Chinese. This offers magnificent views back over rural and urban Taipei. An alternative route, also by means of a 500m-long stairway, leaves from the MRT-Shipai station behind the Veteran General Hospital. Mid-altitude plants such as Pieris taiwanensis Hayata and rough-leaved holly are found alongside the path.\r\n\r\nDanfeng Mountain, at an elevation of 117m, is reached about 350m by a path that leaves from beside the General Chen Ji-tang Mausoleum on Qiyan Road in Old Beitou. The path continues up to Zhaominjing Temple, as does another that starts from Danfeng Heights at Lane 201, Qiyan Road. The temple, also called Lovers&rsquo; Temple is located on Chongyang 7th Road. Taking the southeasterly path from the temple, Junjianyan is about 1.2 kilometers away.\r\n\r\nTwo other routes also lead to this spot, both starting at the Yangming Mountain First Cemetery located at the intersection of Xingyi Road and Quanyuan Road. From 220-12 Quanyuan Road, follow the uphill path inside the cemetery to a fork about 160m further on; the westerly route of Huangxi Mountain (281 meters above sea level) path runs about 1.1 kilometers to Junjianyan, the southerly route about 1.4 kilometers.",

        "introduction": "Chiang Kai-shek Shilin Residence\r\nThe former official residence of Chiang Kai-shek and Madam Chiang maintains a quiet and attractive garden. The garden is full of plums, chrysanthemums and roses favored by the Chiang couple. Flowers bloom according to season and make for a stunning view throughout much of the year.\r\n\r\nChiang Kai-shek Shilin Residence Park\r\nhe CKS Shilin Residence Park is located in Shilin District, to the southeast of where Section 5, Zhongshan N. Road and Fulin Road meet. Surrounded by the Fushan hills, this 9.28-hectare park was named after the late R.O.C. President Chiang Kai-shek, who lived on its premises in 1950. It has well-preserved, enchanting scenic resources both in the outer and inner gardens, the principal room, the greenhouse for potted orchids, the rose garden, Victory Chapel, the New Orchid Pavilion and the Ciyun Pavilion, due to construction projects or renovations having been prohibited in the neighborhood for national security reasons. The Chinese-style inner garden is landscaped with a stream running under an artificial bridge, rock gardens, peculiarly shaped rocks, and a red-painted Chinese summerhouse, whereas the European-style outer garden with carpet bed of exuberant flowers, serves as a theme venue for the annual chrysanthemum exhibitions. The rose garden features 200 species and 4,000-odd plants with roses of varied hues during the peak blooming period from November through April, and was Madame Chiang&rsquo;s favorite location for leisurely strolls. While the Chiang family was baptized in a Christian ceremony and held worship services in the Victory Chapel, the New Orchid Pavilion (aka Longevity Pavilion) is a Chinese-style quadrangular structure built in 1950 to host Mr. Chiang&rsquo;s birthday celebrations; it also serves as a venue for various orchid shows. On Mt. Fushan is the Ciyun Pavilion, a two-story square summerhouse built in memory of Mr. Chiang&rsquo;s mother. After being open to the public in 1996, the CKS Shilin Residence Park has undergone many continued renovation projects to become a scenic, recreational spot in downtown Taipei with enhanced quality and quantity of services, besides brilliant zoning and construction plans.",

The neighborhood was notorious for ITS outdated amenities and a substandard lifestyle that left the city unsightly. In an urban renewal program for Wanhua District, Taipei City Government launched a park expansion plan that added greenery and decorations to reinforce healthy trees/plants already grown in the park in an attempt to improve living quarters and provide greater access to public lawns. The revamped park was inaugurated on November 13, 2006.\r\n\r\nHerbs, including therapeutic Chinese herbs, are grown along Xiyuan Road in the brand-new Park No. 402, where benches and an activity plaza (approx. 256 m2) were installed between the park lanes parallel to Bangka Boulevard and historic buildings. A variety of shrubs (blue butterfly bushes, Osmanthus, etc.) connect the plaza, the buildings and corridor; massive lawns and trees (such as banyans, Fan Palms, Chinese Hackberry, camphor trees and Spindle Palm) abound in the park, offering the neighborhood a perfect bonding place for recreation and chit-chats.",

As the story goes, disease was common to this area in early years, but the lack of Chinese medicine doctors forced the people instead to seek out herbal remedies, including soups with herbal infusions. Because of this, the area also was known then as &#39;salvation street.&#39;\r\n\r\nToday, the shops continue to focus on healthy products, including over one hundred types of herbs, many of them from southern Taiwan. The stores also sell herbal teas to help beat the summer heat.

These somewhat crowded buildings chronicled the tears and joy of veterans who migrated to Taiwan in the early days. This is the former site of Taipei City&rsquo;s Military Dependents&rsquo; Village, called the &ldquo;Sisinan Village&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nWith the increasingly fast economic growth and the rising living standard, these old houses no longer serve the needs of the residents. The City Government initially planned to rebuild them in 1999. However, through persuasion from the cultural circles, the City Government designated this premise as the Cultural Hall and Cultural Park of Xinyi District, and started operation in 2003.\r\n\r\nThe Hall consists of four symmetrical buildings. The houses that sat tightly next to each other have been converted into an open space for events and exhibitions. The premise now consists of an exhibition hall, Military Dependents&rsquo; Village Exhibition Hall, performance hall and community hall. The exterior still retains the unique low-rise and the simple, rustic style of the Military Dependents&rsquo; Village. The narrow alleys and footpaths will take the visitors down memory lane. It is a fascinating contrast to the neighboring towering Taipei 101 and surrounding modern buildings, a compelling testimony of Taipei&rsquo;s urban development.",

Sishou (in Xinyi Dist.) to the east. Among all the scenic parks in Nangang District, Nangang Park is the largest, and the only one with a natural pond. A landmark of Nangang, standing at the park&rsquo;s main entrance is a red Chinese-style memorial gate measuring 13-meters tall and 20-meters wide, on top of which perches a calligraphic work with the golden engraved strokes for &ldquo;Nangang Park&rdquo;. People in the neighborhood enjoy line-dancing or morning exercises on the square in front of the memorial gate, the beauty of which is accentuated by flower beds with regularly updated gardening projects. Tourists, among others, find this memorial gate a perfect backdrop and camera-ready for snapshots.",

Honoring the relationship of &ldquo;human and art&rdquo; as its establishment philosophy, the center lays the foundation of art by promoting arts education in schools; it also works with various parties in promoting aesthetic education, to &ldquo;bring art to life, and bring life to art&rdquo;.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe center is situated within the compound of Nanhai Academy, where many natural and cultural elements are blended beautifully together. The Center was built in the &lsquo;50s, with a new architectural post-war Chinese classical style. The center consists of two main buildings: Nanhai Theater and Nanhai College. There are also Nanhai Outdoor Gallery and Nanhai Arts and Culture Square. The center oversees and promotes school arts education and research, as well as promotion and counselling activities. It is an important place for arts publication, learning and cultivating creative talents.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Taipei Historical Buildings Review Committee reached a conclusion that the building (including Nanhai Theater and Nanhai College) should be considered a &ldquo;historical building&rdquo;. Together with the neighboring National Education Radio and National Museum of History, they form a unique group of structures within &ldquo;Nanhai Academy&rdquo;, preserving historical values and contributing to the beauty of the community landscape.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;",

Mr. Lin did not only translate the word &ldquo;humor&rdquo; into Chinese, but also promoted literature of humor. Famous for being a modern Chinese scholar writing in English, Mr. Lin was a linguist, philosopher, man of letters, traveler and creator.\r\n\r\nIn 1966, Mr. Lin returned and resided in Taiwan. Designed by Mr. Lin, this house integrates the style of Chinese four-chamber architecture and Western aesthetics. With blue tiles and white walls, arches and winding corridors, this house manifests the beauty of classical architecture. As to its site on Yangmingshan, it resembles his hometown in Fujian. When he was still alive, he could hear the dialect he was familiar with &ndash; Southern Fujianese, from time to time, giving him the feel of home.\r\n\r\nOnce he described this house saying, &ldquo;there is a yard in the mansion; house in the yard; garden in the house. There are trees in the garden, sky upon the trees and moon upon the sky. How marvelous it is.&rdquo; Mr. Lin always came to the balcony. After dinner, he loved to sit on a rattan armchair smoking his pipe. Watching the sunset at Guanyin Mountain, you can also feel Mr. Lin&rsquo;s serenity.",

In 1910, the Japanese government tore the temple down to re-plot the urban streets.

You can reach the Park by cycling along Siyuan Street towards the direction of Taipei Water Park. Shrubs grown on the slope ingeniously form the wordings, &ldquo;Guting Riverside Park&rdquo;. Visit the Park on a summer afternoon, when the sun is not so strong, to enjoy the breeze. There are various sports facilities in the Park for citizens&rsquo; enjoyment, such as the tennis court, basketball court and skating rink. Enjoy the expansive green space and take a moment to take in a cool breeze under the bridge. Sports aficionados who often visit here for the facilities know that two adjacent tennis courts were built under the shade, allowing players to stay away from the sun while playing, making the courts an ideal place for a friendly game.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere is a rock climbing practice area and children&rsquo;s playground under Yongfu Bridge, with a thick protective mat under the slide, a statement of the City Government&rsquo;s thoughtfulness. It doesn&rsquo;t seem difficult to adult onlookers as energetic children complete the 3-m high rock climbing wall but the climb is actually quite a challenge when you try it yourself. This is a good place to bring your kids to have fun and beat the summer heat. In the winter, this place will become a sea of garden cosmos, which will attract numerous visitors to stand and gawk. There are well-designed biking trails and lighting in the Park, attracting more cyclists to take their bikes out and enjoy a delightful summer night ride.&nbsp;",

In addition to paper displays, the museum has a demonstration handmade paper factory and offers classes on papermaking. Visitors can also pick up a variety of fine handmade paper items at the museum gift shop.",

        "introduction": "The Taipei City Wall was one of the last city walls to be built during the Qing period. Though only the gates survive, the original fortifications were extremely strong, with walls four meters thick five meters high and extending a total of four kilometers.\r\n\r\nMost Chinese walls have four gates, but the Taipei wall had five. Some say that the fifth gate&mdash;Xiaonanmen (Little South Gate)&mdash;was built especially for the convenience of the family of local tycoon Lin Pen-yuan in Banqiao, though this has never been proved. Whatever the facts, Xiaonanmen is indeed a unique case. The gate was unfortunately destroyed by the Japanese along with the East Gate and South Gate, but after World War II it was rebuilt as a city wall tower in a northern Chinese palace style. Only the foundation endures from the original wall to continue watching over the city Taipei.",

The Rinbansho (quarters of a head priest), nevertheless, is a traditional Japanese residential structure and the Shuxin Hall (a.k.a., Tree Heart Hall) a modernist mix of bricks, European log cabins and Japanese roofing.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA series of government efforts have been made to renovate and reuse the culturally, historically and architecturally significant Nishi Honganji complex. Among others, the Nishi Honganji Square is transformed into an urban attraction and extension of the fashion-forward, buzzing Ximen neighborhood that lure shoppers to moments of nostalgia and memories, in hopes of bringing crowds back to the once-thriving Monga and recreating the area&#39;s former successes by attracting business interests.&nbsp;",

Generously paved with pink and pale blue tiles, the bridge is a modern landmark and also a public facility that can only be accessed by foot and by bicycle. People are often seen strolling on the bridge, which is a shortcut between Neihu and the Raohe Night Market and Songshan Railway Station, drastically saving travel time for those living in the Songshan and Neihu Districts. The Rainbow Bridge attracts many amateur photographers at night, when its illumination adds much to the beauty of the city&rsquo;s nightscape. Meanwhile, the Blue Highway&rsquo;s terminal wharf established here also helps to draw crowds to the bridge, making it an emerging, popular tourist destination for those visiting Taipei.",

With land reclamation and the forming of villages, the interconnection between the towns and villages gradually became important. Other than providing transport connecting the towns and villages, Sanjiaodu is also a harbor for boats of the neighboring residents. Besides agricultural activities, locals also raised ducks, caught clams and fish in the river as means of living. In the later days, due to river improvement works, the harbor gradually lost its functions. The history of Sanjiaodu witnessed the changes of Danshui River; it is a place with significant historical value.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nToday, only a dozen sampan boats dock at Sanjiaodu, wordlessly recounting the stories of the jetty. Master Zheng, born in a ship building family in Sanjiaodu of Jiantan, Taipei, is one of Taiwan&rsquo;s few remaining masters who build dragon boats by hand. By passing down the skills and sowing the seeds of culture, the memories of the waterfront can be continued, and this passion for what was beautiful and valuable can be rekindled.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;",

        "introduction": "Xiangshan derives its name from its external shape (&ldquo;xiang&rdquo; means elephant in Chinese) and is located at the south-eastern section of Xinyi District. Its composition is mainly sandstone, akin to that of Hushan. The tawny cliffs and giant rocks along the path, coupled with numerous natural life forms and birds, make the entire mountain resemble a natural ecological paradise. It&rsquo;s a great place for the general public to enjoy outdoor leisure time and bask in the beauty of nature.\r\n\r\nAlong the trail there are explanatory sign boards providing information to visitors concerning the environment. The diversified cliff and slope terrains form a great nurturing ground for fern-family plants. In particular, the quantity of Taiwanese Cibotium (Cibotium taiwanianum) and Flying Spider-monkey Tree Fern (Cyathea lepifera) ranks top in Taipei City.\r\n\r\nBack in the days when medicine was not as advanced as it is today, Taiwanese Cibotium was commonly used to stop bleeding. The Flying Spider-monkey Tree Fern, on the other hand, is the most valuable ecological feature of Taipei City.\r\n\r\nStanding on the top of Xiangshan, the entire Taipei Basin is right under your eyes. The extension of the ridge reaches into Zhongqiang Park of Xinyi District, and therefore has become the best evening stroll venue for local residents. It is also a great vacation spot for people to relax and relieve stress.\r\n\r\nThe Six Giant Rocks\r\n&ldquo;Laolaixia&rdquo; is the name given to Xiangshan&rsquo;s landscape of peculiar giant rocks. On top of these rocks, the entire view of the bustling Xinyi District is captured; it is a popular spot for photo-taking. The rising sun juxtaposed with Taipei 101 and the slumbering Xinyi District skyscrapers provide endless pictures of enjoyment throughout the day and night.\r\n&nbsp;",

In addition, a two- or three-hundred-year-old Buddhist temple worshipping Guanyin stands on the hillside; it is a place for people to worship or pray for blessings.

The overlook extends across Huanhe North Road to an area jutting over the embankment, providing an excellent view. Standing on the overlook, one can take in the full view of Danshui River, and enjoy Dadaocheng Wharf&rsquo;s fireworks. In addition, the viewing overlook also has water recreation facilities for family activities, as well as a performance stage. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe glass flooring of the viewing platform also features Taipei&rsquo;s three market streets: Dadaocheng, Mengjia and Taipei City. A stone tablet is erected at the entrance, with the inscription, &ldquo;A new prospect&rdquo;, bearing witness to the future of Taipei City, and forecasting the city&#39;s accessibility via sea, land and air.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe main structure of the platform features reinforced concrete (RC) columns and steel reinforced concrete (SRC). Its railings are made of steel and tempered glass. The overall structure uses white as base color, and the entire platform looks like it is pulling an arch steel cable. Nighttime illumination facilities are also available for better lighting. The platform is expected to be a new landmark in Taipei City&#39;s western district.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;",

The imperial seal was also made of jade. Today, jade is frequently made into Buddhist sculptures, necklaces, mobile phone pendants, etc. Wearing jade as an amulet has become many people&rsquo;s favorite accessory.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Guanghua Commercial Zone, there have long been numerous shops and vendors selling jade and antiques. Due to their large number, this area gradually became a jade trading area and then Jade Market. It is a centralized market that sells popularized jade, apart from Jianguo Holiday Jade Market.\r\n\r\nThe jade pieces for sale here come in different sizes and are inexpensive; yet, the quality differs significantly. Thus, if you want to buy a jade piece here, you&rsquo;d better obtain some knowledge about jade appreciation. Also, when making a purchase, you must compare the prices between different vendors to avoid getting ripped off. Overall, you must watch, listen, ask, and learn. With careful selection, you will definitely find something you love.",

In a style common among 19th century correctional facilities worldwide, the now-defunct Taipei Prison featured cell blocks that radiate outward, and high walls made of stones up-cycled from the Taipei Prefecture bulwarks demolished in the 1910s. The prison wall is historically significant in part because they are composed of andesite and Qilian stone sourced during Emperor Guangxu&rsquo;s reign from hillside quarries in Dazhi or Neihu, and transported to the shores of Keelung River; next they were shipped to the Hegoutou Wharf via Tamsui River by boat. The long-winding journey added to the worth of the wall.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

        "introduction": "&ldquo;Tiao&rdquo; in Tiaomi means &ldquo;selling grains&rdquo; in Chinese and &ldquo;Tiaomi&rdquo; means &ldquo;peddling rice&rdquo;. During the period between 1821 and 1850 (Emperor Daoguang&rsquo;s reign), in a move to reduce time spent on transportation and labor, farmers in the Sanchangli area built this narrow mountainous trail as an alternative route to the smoother - yet longer - foot path. There are a total of 500 stone steps on this trail to facilitate quicker transportation of rice in regions like Nangang, Muzha, Shenkeng and Jingmei, and support more frequent trade activities. Since there is a Tiaomi Temple along the trail, the trail becomes its eponym, Tiaomi Historic Trail. &ldquo;Tiaomi&rdquo; also means &ldquo;shouldering rice&rdquo; in Chinese. Legend has it that due to the steep, treacherous steps, carriers at that time had to rest by the Temple when travelling across the region. To express their gratitude to the God of the Earth for blessing them with a safe journey, they would leave a bowl of rice while resting. As time passed by, the residents built a simple temple using stones to show their respect for the God. After several reconstructions, it became the current &ldquo;Tiaomi Temple&rdquo;. There is also the &ldquo;Dexing Coal Mine Entrance&rdquo; near the trail. Dexing Coal Mine started its operation about 1897, and reached its operating prime between 1946 and 1948. This was followed by the exhaustion of the coal vein. The site was abandoned, leaving only the mine entrance as a tourist attraction. The stone steps on Tiaomi Historic Trail resurfaced in 2011 along with the establishment of an arch bridge, wooden path and tourist signposts for the Trail.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

        "introduction": "Nangang Mountain is located at the eastern border of Taipei Basin; it is a popular mountain hiking route due to its connection to Sishou Mountains. Entering from Xiangshan Trail near Lingyun Temple, the path is paved with stones, marked with indicators and surrounded by Taiwan acacia (Acacia confuse). Along the path are numerous shelters and seats donated by Zaojuehui (Morning Exercise Club) that provide resting locations for mountain hikers. The trial is connected to Xiangshan, Hushan and Lishanqiaokou.\r\n\r\nNangang Mountain\r\nDaying Pavilion\r\n\r\nNangang Mountain is located at the intersecting ridge of Xinyi District and Nangang District, and is the highest peak among the Nangang Mountains. On its peak are a glistering lamp and an equilateral triangle No. 695. The 196 m tall Nangang Mountain spans from Changshou Park to Muzhi Mountain, and provides great paths and trails for those who like to hike. At the peak, you&rsquo;ll see four smaller mountains shaped like an elephant, a lion, a leopard and a tiger to the northwest, thus the name Sishou (&ldquo;Four Beasts&rdquo;) Mountains. An endless stream of mountains rises and falls to the east and south. There is a television broadcast antenna at the highest point of Nangang Mountain, with nearby ridges having sharp differences in altitude. One of the peaks is known as the &ldquo;95 Peak&rdquo;, so named after General Yang Sen, who conquered this peak at the ripe age of 95.\r\n\r\nA serene, peaceful trail\r\nXiangshan (Mt. Elephant) and Hushan (Mt. Tiger) belong to the same mountain series, but their sceneries are not as diverse as here. The later section of the trail is more tranquil with richer forest ecology than the Hushan Trail. Further down, the murmuring sound of creek and archaic bridge enhance the placid ambiance.",

Later, it became the land designated for a park. The entire valley maintains almost the same ecological landscape that existed more than a hundred years ago. There are abundant plants in the park, with insects calling and birds singing, where natural resources such as low-elevation forests and streams are also preserved. The rare ecological park in the City is divided into several areas: Natural Succession Area, Butterfly Watching Area, Formosan Giant Flying Squirrel Observation Area and Taipei Tree Frog Observation Area. Other than tree frogs, butterflies and Formosan Giant Flying Squirrels, the Park has a total of 5000 trees covering 331 plant species, such as: Incense machilus (Machilus zuihensis), Formosa acacia (Acacia confusa), Turn In The Wind (Mallotus paniculatus), Elephant&rsquo;s Ear (Macaranga tanarius), etc. In the surroundings, there are houses of the military dependents&rsquo; village, preserved forts, culverts and vicissitudinous stone steps. Marks of painstaking efforts made by the military officers are clearly evident. Standing among these old structures would give visitors an odd feeling of having a soulfuls communication with the older generation.",

        "introduction": "Jiqin Village has been the keeper of the &ldquo;Christmas Alley&rdquo; custom for 16 years, which dates back to the Christmas Eve in 1999, when Father Lin Gongzhao of San&rsquo;ai Church in the community moved the Christmas tree outdoor. Other members of the Church followed his example, decorating Christmas trees outside their homes and caroling in the neighborhood. Afterwards, other residents of the alley, who were inspired by the joyful, festive tradition, also joined in. With the joint efforts of the Chief of Jiqin Village Mr. Huang Shengzhong, carpenter Wen Yongyan, Associate Professor Pan Tongtai of Taipei Chengshih University of Science &amp; Technology and Father Lin of San&rsquo;ai Church, the &ldquo;Christmas Alley&rdquo; started to expanded yearly, and its fame spread like wildfire. Now, every Christmas season, the decorating of Christmas trees is a center-stage festive activity for all residents. In December every year, the residents will voluntarily decorate their homes, and some may even begin planning and designing new ornaments or installations months in advance. It is as if the residents have reached a tacit agreement to light up the Christmas trees one week before Christmas, until Lantern Festival of the following year. The decoration of &ldquo;Christmas Valley&rdquo; in Jiqin Village is done on a household basis. The windowsills and yards of each house in the alley will be filled with exquisite designs. The themes and motifs vary from Jiqin high speed rail, cable car, helicopter, to the yellow rubber duck, etc.&nbsp;",

The century-old main structure was unveiled later in 1913 and is largely still preserved today, thanks to frequent restoration efforts. Initially used to house classrooms and an administrative center, the main structure grew into a national hub of medical research, a fortress of medical education reform, a site of medical humanities education and, in 2008, a museum. In addition to permanent exhibits such as &ldquo;A New Born&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Peopling of Taiwan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Taiwanese People&rsquo;s Struggle against Diseases&rdquo;, the Museum offers special exhibits every six months to explore the impact of medical studies. It also displays exhibit items at medical education institutions nationwide. In the style of the later French Renaissance, the stately museum features graceful curves and carvings in the lobby, on the main wall and columns, with arched designs sumptuously used in the lobby and hallways for extra elegance. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in 1930 and destroyed the Mansard-style, slanted roof with slates, bronze and a little round window on top of it.\r\n\r\nFront entrance\r\nThe west wing was first constructed in 1907\r\nThe semi-outdoor corridor in the south wing, photographed by Jack M.

It is also the oldest among the three.&nbsp;According to the extant inscription, &ldquo;Zhi Lan Temple Inscription&rdquo;, from the Qianlong reign of Qing Dynasty, the temple&#39;s beginning can be traced back to &ldquo;Fu De Ancestral Hall&rdquo; in Xiashulinpu as early as the 48th year of Emperor Kangxi reign (1709). However, since the landmark was destroyed in a flood in the 6th year of Emperor Qianlong reign (1741), the locals rebuilt the temple on Zhilan Street.\r\n\r\nShen Nong Temple was known as &ldquo;Zhi Lan Temple&rdquo; in the old days. Due to the fact that the people worshipped Fu De Zheng Shen (the Earth God) as the main deity, it was hence also called &ldquo;Fu De Temple&rdquo;. During the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, Shen Nong Emperor (also known as Emperor of the Five Grains) was established as the main deity, &nbsp;the temple was hence renamed, &ldquo;Shen Nong Temple&rdquo;.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAn ancient incense burner from the Qing Dynasty, a longevity tablet with the temple record from the Qing Dynasty, five steles from the Qianlong to Daoguang reigns, and a pair of stone pillars from the Japanese colonial period are among the historical monuments still extant.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;",

The lake referred to was said to be inhabited by a malevolent water sprite who stirred up waves that killed countless people over the years. One day, while passing by the lake with his troops, Cheng hurled a jeweled sword at the water sprite, killing the beast and calming the waters.\r\n\r\nHistoric records of the Tamsui Prefectural Government indicate that Jiantan Temple was built in Jiantan in 1773 with funds donated by Wu Ting-kao and other patrons. The records also note that a plaque at the temple recounts a story, in which the Monk Wanhua came across a snake blocking the road while traveling through the area. The monk divined this to be an auspicious incident, and therefore ordered a temple to be built on the spot. He later had a dream instructing him the eight ships from Shanghai would pass by Keelung, providing funds to build the temple. The temple was constructed on the designated spot, but was moved during the later part of the Japanese occupation period to its current location. At the front of the temple stands a monumental arch with a green-tile roof, below which is an inscription of the temple&#39;s name. The narrow lane inside is the original site of the temple, and in the wooded garden here one can still see the original age-worn temple columns and stela.",

        "introduction": "Converted from a weather-beaten principal&rsquo;s dormitory of Muzha Elementary School, the Japanese-style Wenshan Public Assembly Hall is a mix of pristine and modern, old and new. During a negotiation meeting in May, 1999&mdash; the purpose of which was to build a consensus over land use between community planners and representatives of NGOs, school faculty, parents and residents &mdash;a series of Local Leaders&rsquo; Workshops, hearings and general planning sessions were held. The assembly hall project had faced one challenge after another until its groundbreaking ceremony in 2002 and inauguration on October 19th of that same year. A successful example of property renewal, the assembly hall has not only given a new breath of life to an exquisite Japanese structure that was first unveiled in 1927, but also emerged as a hub of effort to preserve the neighborhood&rsquo;s historical and industrial legacies in the midst of reinforced interest in community engagement.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBuilt on a 636-m2 estate opposite Wenshan District Office that shoulders Muzha Elementary School, with Jingmei River to its east, the assembly hall is an elegant symbol of grassroots support and heritage preservation, complete with an information desk, an auditorium and a multi-purpose outdoor space ideal for lectures, public art displays, the &ldquo;Classroom under the Trees&rdquo; participatory landscape projects, and exhibitions of all sorts.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition to photographic displays illustrating Wenshan District&rsquo;s evolution and economic lifelines, the assembly hall&rsquo;s two-story new building features exhibits and activities at irregular intervals that involve artists, civic groups or community organizations (on both floors, space is available for rent) in an attempt to encourage high-quality, culturally sophisticated living.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe assembly hall&rsquo;s old, Japanese-era building was remodeled into an open exhibition space available for lease by individual visitors or groups for academic workshops and intellectually inspiring seminars. Stop by the old-meets-new Wenshan Public Assembly Hall and you will be impressed by how architecturally refined it is, as well as how historically, industrially and ecologically distinctive Wenshan District has always been!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

It is Taipei City&rsquo;s second standard sanitary landfill, covering an area of about 65 hectares. The landfill ground has an area of 30 hectares, and a capacity of about 6.17 million m3. 21 hectares of the landfill ground has already been filled and covered, and then converted into green space by means of vegetation restoration. It now has a totally different landscape from the former landfill, resembling the ambience described in the poem, &ldquo;Fishermen&rdquo;, written by Liu Zong-Yuan, a poet from Tang dynasty; the Park was hence named, &ldquo;Shanshuilu Eco Park&rdquo;.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nVarious facilities in the Park were built with facilities you see now standing at the park, which were surprisingly abandoned at one time. There are also interactive and fun environmental education commentary facilities. In addition, on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 am to 4 pm, there are free children&rsquo; games (stilt walking, hoop rolling, top spinning) and free bicycle rental for visitors. The vast garden is also an ideal place for kite flying. During daytime, you can overlook downtown Nangang and Neihu&rsquo;s mountainous region from the observation deck, while at night you can enjoy the night view of vehicles on Highways No.3 and No.5. The Park is an ideal recreational place for the entire family to get close to nature and experience ecological fun.",

The merchant, who was staying away from home, worshipped the statue day and night. However, after his business failed, he lost interest in worshipping, and abandoned the statue in a forest. One evening, a woman saw the statue. Not knowing where the deity was from, she gathered many people in a ceremonial reception to welcome the deity. An old man felt that the statue bore resemblance to Imperial Lord Wen Chang, the deity who looks after the fortune and reputation of people. Hence, they built a small temple on Lane 45 of Minsheng East Road to properly worship it. Later, most believers seeking academic success came to worship the statue. It was said that their wishes were oftentimes granted.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt is the only temple in the district that enshrines Imperial Lord Wen Chang. It has many worshippers, and students who come to pray for success during the examination period often have their wishes come true.&nbsp;",

The Ice Land, a secondary venue of Taipei Arena, is a year-round ice-skating rink with an international standard size, besides offering standardized indoor ice for such sports as ice hockey and speed skating. The Ice Land is available for public skating on weekdays;it also offers an array of education/training programs, accommodating up to 800 seats in the audience area. In addition, there are also 6,000+ m2 of business area inside the Taipei Arena to offer audiences a comfortable dining and recreational experience.

The City&rsquo;s Geotechnical Engineering Office spent a hefty sum on a renovation effort that added hiking trails, observation decks and industrial roads to the park project, which connects the Neishuangxi mountain areas in Neihu and Shilin Districts. The effort resulted in the integration of Neishuangxi woodlands, the forest park, the Bishan Campsite, the Baishihu Agricultural Community, and many other scenic and ecological resources to set local tourism in motion.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the forest park, the Bixi Bridge is flanked by Formosan Tree Frogs carved out of stone to underscore the ecological diversity in &ldquo;Little Xitou.&rdquo; From the semicircular view deck built along bridge guardrails, visitors are treated to a visual feast of streams murmuring against a backdrop of peculiarly shaped rocks on Mt. Shitou. On the hiking trail, a 6-meter-tall, spectacular viewing platform made of 100% black sandalwood is propped up by four log columns and overlooks Dalunwei and Yuanshanzi Mountains; it is complete with a plum blossom-shaped public square at the entrance for hikers to catch their breath and take a short break. User-friendly, interactive sessions are also available at the park&rsquo;s demonstration solar cell-powered system to promote energy conservation.\r\n\r\nThe Neishuangxi Forest Park&rsquo;s ecological diversity is attributable to the plentiful water resources in Bixi Catchment Area, a location where species native to the ancient Xueshan Mountain Range and the emerging Datun Mountain Range meet and highlighting the scenic beauty of various landforms. That is why the park is able to provide recreation based on a pleasant, relaxed and environmentalist lifestyle.",

The showroom&rsquo;s displayed items were relocated to the Lottery Bureau behind the present-day Presidential Office, and gave rise to the 1908 opening of Taiwan Viceroy&rsquo;s Office Museum. During 1913, the Qing-dynasty Tianhou Temple in what is now the 228 Peace Memorial Park was torn down to make way for the &ldquo;Viceroy Kodama Gentaro and Chief Civil Administrator Goto Shinpei Memorial Museum&rdquo;, which was a new project intended to house the Taiwan Viceroy&rsquo;s Office Museum collection. It was rechristened the &ldquo;Museum of Taiwan Province&rdquo; in 1945 and &ldquo;Taiwan Provincial Museum&rdquo; in 1949, before receiving its current title &ldquo;National Taiwan Museum&rdquo; in 1999.\r\n\r\nSitting at the other end of Guanqian Road from Taipei Main Station, the National Taiwan Museum features a Grecian fa&ccedil;ade with towering columns, an acanthus leaves-embellished pediment and a domed hall accentuated by 32 columns, each with an ornate Corinthian capital, in addition to stained-glass skylights through which sunlight filters to cast dazzling patterns on the ground. While sentimentally bearing witness to Taiwan&rsquo;s history, the Museum offers exhibitions as well as irregular events on a scale much unchanged since its founding.",

He is revered along with the Eight Justice deities, including General Jia and General Suo.\r\n\r\nThe Bangka Qingshan Temple was built over a century ago. The temple is arranged in a three-courtyard layout, with buildings made of wood and stone. The temple has been well maintained over the years and continues to greet visitors with its abundant charms, including a beautiful octagonal plafond. The stone columns and buttresses are carved of stone from the old Yuanshan Shinto Shrine. The statue of Qingshan Wang is especially eye-catching&mdash;literally: the god&rsquo;s eyes seem to follow you no matter where you stand!",

After its inauguration in 1933 as the dormitory for Category-3 high-ranking officials in the Japanese colonial period, the house was taken over in 1951 by the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) to accommodate the teaching staff of the school&rsquo;s Department of Economic Management. Liang moved into the house when he was appointed the Head of NTNU&rsquo;s Department of English in 1952. Considering Liang&rsquo;s far-reaching influence as a great educator, editor of English-Chinese dictionaries and high school English textbooks, his former residence was therefore listed among Taipei City&rsquo;s cultural assets in 2003 to commemorate his standing as a paragon teacher.",

The first section of trail is known as the Beixing Temple Trail; the Lishanqiaokou Trail is the later section of the trail.\r\n\r\nSnake-shaped forest\r\nThis trail is at least a century old and was once used by local folks as a route for rice and tea transportation to and from Songshan (Xikou) and Sifenzi (Sec. 4 of Yanjiuyuan Rd.). Along the path, one will find the rare snake-like tree ferns, Cyathea lepifera. Since not many people traverse this path, a sense of primitive tranquility permeates the air.\r\nUnlike the other trails in the Nangang Mountain system, Lishanqiaokou Trail still has a section of the original soil path. During sunny days, the refreshing smell of the soil raises memories for urbanites. But be careful on rainy days as the path can be slippery.\r\n\r\nBeixing Temple Trail\r\nBeixing Temple\r\nThis trail is even and easy to traverse due to its stone-paved path and shade from the trees. The signboards on the side of the path containing messages such as &ldquo;Good Health!&rdquo; and &ldquo;The People of Houshanpi Care for You!&rdquo; bring a warm feeling to hikers.\r\n\r\nThe first section of the trail falls within the Xinyi Business District, and one see the high-rise skyscrapers of the bustling region.

In 1875, the Qing court raised the status of Tamsui Subprefecture to Taipei Prefecture, and Chen Xing-Ju was put in charge of Taipei Prefecture. In 1881, Taipei Prefecture built Taipei Prefecture City God Temple behind Futai Street, at the junction of Fuzhi Street and Beimen Street (junction of Yanping South Road and Hankou Street). During the Japanese colonial period, City God Temple was demolished, and was later rebuilt in the current location after Taiwan retrocession. With its accessibility and surrounding booming businesses, it is a center of worship for the nearby residents. The name of the City God has also attracted both local and overseas worshipers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe temple is the biggest one of its kind in Taipei City. It enshrines the City God as its main deity, in addition to Sakyamuni Buddha, Medicine Buddha, Amitabha Buddha, Goddess of Mercy and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, Imperial Lord Guan Yu, Imperial Lord Fu You, Imperial Lord Wen Chang, Monk Ji Gong, Wife of the City God, Fu De Zheng Shen (Earth God), etc. Inside the temple, the couplets, horizontal inscribed board, the ceramic cutting and pasting, drawings or carvings, aim to deliver one message: &ldquo;pursue good fortune and steer clear of disaster, and enlighten the soul&rdquo;, and &ldquo;unconsciously influenced by environment&rdquo;, to help provide insightful guidance to worshippers.&nbsp;",

It is a relatively low-latitude region for quillwort in the world. Aquatic fern, such as Taiwan quillwort, is very hard to find; to preserve the national treasure, Menghuan Lake has been set as an ecological preserving zone. General tourists are not allowed in the Menghuan Lake area; they can view it from a sightseeing deck next to the Lake.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nCompared to other places, Menghuan Lake has more rain in spring and summer. When the rainy season or heavy rain passes, the Lake will overflow. If it happens to encounter the mist on the mountain, the beautiful lake surface accompanied by the mist will make you feel that you are in a secret fantasy land in the fairy tale.",

It is said that when the god was taken to Zhishan, miraculous events occurred. Huiji Temple was built in dedication to the god at Zishanyan in 1752. Later, when Guanyin was worshiped here as well, the temple was also known as Zhishanyan Temple. At the temple is an ink brush stand that is said to confer divine blessing to all who touch it. Many parents bring their children here to touch the stand, hoping it will help them pass their school examinations.",

As the most significant economic crop of the place, the current production volume of Calla Lilies in Zhuzihu accounts for more than 80% of the total in Taiwan.\r\n\r\nZhuzihu Hydrangea Festival\r\nAt the end of May, the romantic view of the white floral sea comes to an end. The upcoming scenery will be the purple blue hydrangea blossoms during the holiday of Dragon Boat Festival.\r\n\r\nAbout 7 to 8 varieties of hydrangeas are planted in the Zhuzihu area.

        "introduction": "Situated in Dadaocheng&rsquo;s historic quarter, the branch of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan was built on a piece of property donated by Li Chun-sheng, a prominent figure in contemporary Taiwan. It is believed that Li modeled the main church structure after Western houses of worship he found in China&rsquo;s Xiamen area. As part of the Christian outreach efforts in Taiwan, the church installed a main structure in the early days of Japan&rsquo;s Taisho period, reinforced with premium red bricks, excellent craftsmanship and a West-meets-East fa&ccedil;ade.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nChristianity&rsquo;s growing acceptance in Taipei from the late 19th to early 20th century is evidenced by the church&rsquo;s key features, such as segregated seating, performed at a time when gender equality was unheard-of, and men and women were required to use the left and right entrances, separately. Despite its resemblance of its European precedents, this historic church has been praised as a rarity in contemporary Taiwanese architecture for its unique fa&ccedil;ade &mdash; with an exposed-aggregate finish that is half-Taiwanese, and half-European, stately yet welcoming &mdash; and thus designated as the City&rsquo;s 100th historic monument. Among its little-known highlights is a musical clock, which comprises 25 bells of various sizes and marks noon (12:00 p.m.) with 7 different tunes on a rotating basis.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Visitors can then toss coins into the wishing pool by the temple, aiming for one of six earthen bowls representing marriage, health and wealth, depending on the nature of their wish. There is also a wishing pavilion where visitors can hang the wooden wish tablets. The inscription at the pavilion reads, &quot;True love goes unseen, but false affections are known to heaven.&quot; It is a reminder for lovers to cherish their feelings and not be deceptive in love, and a wish that everyone will find their perfect match.",

The current Chen Tian-lai Residence at No. 73, Gui&rsquo;de Street used to house the former Jinji Tea Co. This three-story Baroque structure was completed in 1920 with the first floor dedicated to tea trading, the second floor serving as a guesthouse for tea-traders, and the third floor as private residence. The main structure of this imposing European-style house, flanked by guard towers on both sides, as well as classic colonnade and arched hallway, is adorned with baroque details as festoons and balconies. This historic residence used to be a renowned tea party spot in Dadaocheng, where tea-traders met regularly at the guesthouse to enjoy the view at the Tamsui Wharf in the distance. Behind the Residence, a private garden adjacent to Gang-zi Ditch (the present-day Xining North Road) bears testimony to the heyday of Dadaocheng in the first half of the 20th century.",

Together with the nearby Huajiang Wild Duck Nature Park, they provide the Wanhua District a nice place for leisure and relaxation activities.\r\n\r\nThe long stairway by the riverbank is a good place to watch the sunrise. With its wide horizon, one can see the beautiful reflection of the sun on the surface of the river. On a fine weather day, you will see the morning sun slowly rising from the side of the Taipei 101 skyscraper at a distance, with the morning rays occasionally seeping through the clouds and casting glorious reflections on the Xindian River, forming a river of gold, which is truly mesmerizing.\r\n\r\nA mound was erected in the Machangding Memorial Park, and the stele in front of the mound is inscribed with this message: &ldquo;1950s marked a martial law period where hot-blooded men and righteous men who pursued social justice and political reform were arrested and executed near the Machangding mound.

In addition to complicated traditional techniques, Li also introduced several innovative craftsman skills, especially in exquisite copper relief and statues. Dubbed as an oriental art palace, this temple is a dream-come-true of an artist who combines artistic skills of Japan and Europe in his work. There is always a metaphor or a story to tell at any corner of this place, which is not only a busy temple, but also a piece of architecture with very high artistic value.",

The Xinbeitou branch line was constructed in order to utilize the hot spring for tourism development. Later, the &quot;Xinbeitou Chengjiangsuo (railway stop)&quot; was established and renamed as &quot;Xinbeitou Yi (station)&quot; in 1916 (Taisho 5). The name of the place, Xinbeitou, was thus created. In 1988, because of the suspension of the Beidan Line, the station body was removed and relocated to Taiwan Folk Village in Changhua.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, the Taipei City Government and non-governmental organizations started striving to bring the station back since people began to notice the significance of cultural assets preservation. After people&rsquo;s persistent efforts, Ri Rong Assets Co., Ltd. was touched by the citizens&rsquo; passion and expectations for the return of the station and donated Xinbeitou Station to the Department of Cultural Affairs of Taipei City Government for free.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, the reassembly location of the station was determined to be near the original site in Qixing Park. In April 2017, the restoration was finished and the station was open to the public again.",

        "introduction": "Charcoal was the main fuel in the old days, which was used in cooking, heating, etc. Datun mountain region has rich resources such as acacia trees, and was an excellent place for the development of the charcoal industry. It was also the means of living when the ancestors first came to this place. For example, Wu&#39;s charcoal kiln in Zhongzheng Mountain of Beitou has a history of more than 160 years.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlong Zhongzhengshan Hiking Trail (south of Datun Mountains), due to fuel requirement, the charcoal industry flourished after Taiwan retrocession, until the &lsquo;70s. However, with the rise of the oil industry, the charcoal industry went into decline and almost disappeared from Beitou District altogether. Today, even though the charcoal industry is no longer part of the economic activity, it has been appropriately transformed into a local cultural asset. For example, within &ldquo;Erqi Farm&rdquo; of Beitou Farmers&rsquo; Association, there is a restored charcoal kiln which has stopped operation for 30 years. The top of the kiln is like an arched tortoise shell, and is covered with soil. A double-pitched thatched roof was constructed on top and a mono-pitched thatched roof, called &ldquo;Gou-Zui-Liao-Zai&rdquo; (dog mouth house), was constructed above the combustion chamber to keep away the wind and rain. The owner of the charcoal kiln at Shibafen&rsquo;s farm demonstrates charcoal burning during the tour, and introduces tourists to this ancient industry.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;",

        "introduction": "The College of Law of National Taiwan University, located in Xuzhou Road, was the former site of the Taihoku College of Commerce during the Japanese Colonial Period. The building architecture is exquisite classic western style. The front gate is made of sandstone produced in Taipei with copper lamps installed on the top to convey a primitive simplicity. The pond and garden still remain in the square inside the gate. The Administrative Building is of a splendid, ornate Baroque style. The fa&ccedil;ade of the architecture has classic Greek pillars and semi-arches, and roof is covered with Japanese black tiles. It is a building where Chinese and Western creativity and ingenuity mix, exhibiting a unique beauty. As for the interior, in the spacious auditorium with a wide-span, the rostrum and seats are mostly valuable originals. In addition, the plane of this historic site is in the form of a four-section compound, with a courtyard in the middle. The verdant courtyard and campus, flowers and plants shining with the reflections from the pond, form a tranquil and classic scene worthy of being cherished and preserved.",

The renovation was completed on November 13, 2019, and the announcement of its official opening was made.\r\n\r\nThough the makeshift market is a temporary building, it is still designed with the concept of green architecture, including the preservation of a great number of existing arbor trees on the site.

It is situated at Fude Street, by the foot of Tiger Mountain of the &ldquo;Four Beasts Mountains&rdquo;. It originates from first the year of Tongzhi reign (1862). At that time, an ancestor from Tangshan came to Taiwan alone, and resided in the cave of Tiger Mountain. He hung a red silk writing that read, &ldquo;The Heavenly Emperor and various deities&rdquo; by the walls of the cave entrance, and set up an incense burner on the rock to worship it. However, the cave was damaged during the Japanese colonial period. In 1954, people rebuilt a temple with bamboo at the same location to pay tribute to the Heavenly Emperor. In 1959, it was officially named &ldquo;Songshan Feng Tian Temple&rdquo;. From 1967 to 1977, it continued to expand, where the main hall was renovated, and a pilgrim building and library were built. With a floor area of more than 3,300m2, the place is able to accommodate more than a thousand pilgrims. From here, one can overlook The Presidential Office Building, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, CKS Memorial Hall, The Grand Hotel, International Trade Building, Grand Hyatt Taipei and City Hall, and is an excellent place of worship and enjoying the scenery.&nbsp;",

A separate Shuren Academy was later built at Wenchang Temple on Dihua Street Section 2 in Taipei City. During the school examination period, students flock to the temple to make offerings of foods with symbolic meaning, such as tangerines (good luck), scallions (intelligence and skill), kumquats (examination success), turnips (good fortune), and sweet osmanthus leaves (assistance from persons of noble standing).\r\n\r\nWenchang Temple also occupies an important place in the history of Dalongdong as the origin of the local public school system and a memorial to the educational spirit of the early residents of this area.",

It is the geographical center of an area in southern Taipei that features culturally significant streets and places in the history of Taiwan&rsquo;s post-war literature, which include Kuling Street and two national universities. The area is the cradle of literary magazines/societies and prestigious publishers such as the Blue Star Club, the Chinese Literature and Arts Association, and Pure Literature Co. As the center of a literary Mecca where Lin Hai-yin and Lin Liang strived toward realizing their visions, alongside other prominent writers, Kishu An will be revamped as a historic symbol of Taiwanese literature.",

The temple rises four floors and is built in a traditional Chinese palace-style with white outer railings and vermilion pillars adding to its stately appearance. It is said that during the temple&#39;s construction, workers worked hard but unsuccessfully to dig a well. Later a water source was found behind the temple purportedly with divine guidance, earning the temple site designation as sacred ground. The spring flows with clear sweet water that is well suited for making tea.\r\n\r\nAdherents of I-Kuan Tao worship both eastern and western gods and this eclectic spirit is also reflected in the temple. In addition to the statue of the movement founder, visitors will see the Maitreya Buddha, smiling gaily without worries in the main hall, with Guanyin (Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva) and the Taoist deity Guan Gong (Guan Sheng Di Jun) on the two sides. The temple often holds classes for spiritual cultivation and moral guidance and scripture classes for children.",

The premises were one of Taiwan&rsquo;s pioneers of modern industry, as well as the first professional tobacco plant. A gracefully simple Japanese modernist structure, the factory features meticulously crafted face cams, glasswork and bronze nails that made it arguably a &ldquo;model factory&rdquo; at that time. When Japan lost the war in 1945, the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau took over the factory and renamed it, Songshan Tobacco Factory of Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau. The factory ceased production of cigarettes in 1998 for concerns over urban planning, regulatory changes in the tobacco and liquor marketing system, as well as shrinking demand. It became a relic of the past after being merged into the Taipei Cigarette Plant.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, the Taipei City Government named the tobacco factory the city&rsquo;s 99th historic site and converted it into a park comprising city-designated historic sites (namely the office building, the 1st to 5th warehouses, cigarette plant and boiler room), historic structures (the inspection room, a machinery repair shed and a nursing room) and architectural highlights (the Baroque-style garden, an ecologically landscaped pond, a public bath and a multi-purpose auditorium). For more efficient reuse of space, the Songshan Cultural and Creative Park was built on the historic site as a production base for designers and cultural &amp; creative businesses, as well as a venue for performances and exhibitions. The park introduced to its premises a Taiwan Design Museum and TMSK through partnerships with the Taiwan Design Center and prestigious Taiwanese glasswork label LIULI GONG FANG, respectively, besides a snack bar that was converted from the machinery repair shed.",

On the 2nd Saturday of the 3rd month of the Lunar calendar, grand events such as holy pilgrimage and Bihu fireworks festival will be held to celebrate Mazu&rsquo;s birthday; these are Neihu&rsquo;s largest religious events. &ldquo;Neihu Mazu&rdquo;, enshrined in Neihu Mazu Temple, has always been the center of local belief. However, something special is that in the early days, Mazu&rsquo;s statue was enshrined by Neihu District&rsquo;s representative of the believers on a rotational basis. In recent years, it is enshrined temporarily at the Preparatory Office of Neihu Mazu Temple on Lane 46 of Lishan Street, giving an odd spectacle of a god without a temple. However, it never diminishes the believers&rsquo; devotion. The annual holy pilgrimage always attracts pilgrims from all over Taiwan.",

In addition to three ponds, scenic highlights and the balmy weather thanks to its location in the lee side of Mt. Datun, the Erziping Trail Recreation Area spans the subtropical and warm temperate zones, making it virtually Nature&rsquo;s classroom with impressively diverse vegetation ranging from forest trees (mostly Red Nanmu, Japanese Black Pine and Chinese Sweet Gum), arborescent plants, shrubs and ferns of all kinds, to food plants for butterflies, nectar-yielding plants and aquatic plants. It is perfect for a casual stroll and also for such activities as butterfly- and bird-watching, mountaineering, hiking, sightseeing, day-tripping and flora observation.",

In 1961, it exchanged land with its neighbor, Tong-Yi Hotel, and was rebuilt as a two-story archaic style temple. Later, due to old age, the building underwent a large scale renovation, which started in 2000. The new building covers an area of 660m2, and has three storys and three levels of basement.\r\n\r\nThe new Jing Fu Temple has exquisite carvings, and most of the building materials for this structure were imported from China to ensure quality. Besides the dragon pillars in front of the main hall which are carved from a piece of diabase, the Door Gods on the temple doors are also carved from a block of red sandalwood. A highlight of the building is the large piece of &ldquo;Dragon Parade&rdquo; carving on the ceiling, which differs from common caisson ceilings. Worshippers can see the vivid &ldquo;Green Dragon&rdquo; dancing when they look up. The &ldquo;Eighteen Arhats&rdquo; carving on both sides of the main hall on the third story blend in with the landscape drawing, portraying the beauty of religious art.&nbsp;",

Rd., the site of Nylon Cheng&rsquo;s self-immolation in a free speech campaign, with a memorial sign bearing the name &ldquo;Liberty Lane&rdquo;, which was inaugurated by Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin on August 21st of the same year.\r\n\r\nMayor Hao friendliness and tolerance have always been Taipei City&rsquo;s most valuable cultural assets, and the respect for different cultures, opinions and political ideologies not only lends a touch of gentleness and diversity to the City&rsquo;s overall ambiance, it also constitutes a critical part of the philosophy underlying life in Taipei. This explains why Liberty Lane and Nylon Cheng Memorial Museum are significant in terms of tourism and culture, and also why they are a critical asset in Taiwan&rsquo;s democratic education for the younger generation.\r\n\r\nNylon Cheng Memorial Museum in Liberty Lane was built on the former office site of the now-discontinued Freedom Era Weekly. The entrance is decorated with a bronze statue and a huge portrait of Cheng. In the solemn space inside the building, there is a memorabilia display which contains Cheng&rsquo;s personal items, manuscripts, memorabilia and photographs of his activism in democratic movements and old publications of Freedom Era Weekly. Currently receiving visitors on a reservation basis, the museum provides insights into the sacrifice and contributions made by this Taiwanese martyr of democracy and free speech through documentaries and guided tours. Visitors are expected to develop newfound respect for this martyred hero of democracy, and understand why the City government is making every effort to uphold free speech as a hard-earned, prized asset.",

When China&rsquo;s Nationalist Government relocated to Taiwan in 1949, the then-President Chiang Kai-shek moved into the quiet Grass Mountain Chateau, previously a guest house of Taiwan Sugar Company. Perched strategically on the mountaintop, the chateau commands a view of such natural phenomena as the Guandu Plain, Shezidao and Mt. Guanyin. Grass Mountain was renamed as Yangmingshan in 1950 in memory of the great philosopher Wang Yang-ming.\r\n\r\nThe 4,275 m2 Chateau has a Japanese-style main parlor which was common in the 1920s. Occupying an area of 584 m2 with aged trees by its gate, the main parlor is an embodiment of nostalgia that consists of the hallway, lobby, reception room, study room, bedroom, master bedroom, living room, guest room, kitchen, atrium, balcony, etc. The four smaller structures surrounding the main parlor, which had been the dormitories of Mr. Chiang&rsquo;s bodyguards, were converted by the city government into artists&rsquo; studios as part of an aesthetic space. Eventually, those visiting the chateau will be able to engage themselves in unobstructed dialogues concerning ecology, culture and arts.",
