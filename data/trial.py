    23: "Located on Section 1 of Dihua Street, Xiahai City God Temple was built in 1856 (Xianfeng Year 6) and covers an area of ââabout 46 square meters. Although it does not have a towering temple, its popularity and incense offerings are immense. Every time a god-welcoming ritual competition takes place, it is always bustling and considered a major local event, closely related to the local development of Dadaocheng. The main deity worshipped in the City God Temple is the Lord Xiahai, with two associate judges (civil and military judges) and two generals (Seven and Eight Lords) from the temple. Thirty-eight righteous warriors are also enshrined. There used to be over six hundred deities in the City God Temple before 1994. Currently, there are only about 200. It was once the temple with the highest density of deities in Taiwan and was a spectacle. In Xiahai City God Temple, apart from the City God, the most attractive thing for visitors is the worship of the Matchmaker God. Every year, over 6,000 couples come to express their gratitude with ceremonial cakes. Among them, the most popular are the 'Husband-Controlling Shoes' (also known as 'Happiness Shoes'), a famous 'love talisman' in Taipei. On average, more than 200 couples visit Xiahai City God Temple each year to 'ask for shoes.' According to legend, there is a 70-year age difference between the City God and the City God's wife. The belief among the people is that this 'divine couple' can bring happiness to the family, giving rise to the origin of the 'Husband-Controlling Shoes.' In folklore, there is also a miraculous story about the City God Temple. In 1884, during the Sino-French War, when the French army attacked Taiwan, the people of Taipei came here to pray sincerely for the protection of the Lord Xiahai. The City God indeed showed great divine power. In the end, the French army was defeated and only reached Wudu, failing to capture Taipei. Therefore, the people commonly referred to Xiahai City God as 'Wailing Lord.'",

    31: "Dahu Park, known as 'Egret Lake' due to the presence of flocks of egrets, is located in the Neihu District, Section 5 of Chenggong Road. It is adjacent to Mt. Egret, with a view extending to Five Finger Mountain, Zhongyong Mountain, and others. It covers an area of about 13 hectares. Modeled after Chinese gardens, it was constructed in the 68th year of the Republic of China and the lake area of Dahu is approximately 10 hectares. It is a regional park. With its proximity to the mountains and lakes, winding and twisting water's edge, shimmering lake surface, and broad field of vision, the arched bridge seems to form a rainbow. Whenever the mist covers the mountains in spring, the new willows brush against the water, and distant misty shadows all come into view; resting in the pavilion, it is suitable for both gazing and leisure. The ever-changing clouds and water allow one to roam freely with their gaze, presenting a beautiful scenery. In the seasons of summer and autumn, the misty rain permeates, creating a scene resembling a painting. In May 2012, it was featured in the French World Report. However, since the development of Dahu Park more than thirty years ago, there have been many issues. Therefore, in 2008, the park began planning and designing the Dahu Park Environmental Transformation Project in the hopes of revitalizing the park. In order to minimize the impact on citizens' recreational activities, the 'Dahu Park Environmental Transformation Project' was carried out in two phases. The first phase included the addition of a green square with ample shading from large trees for citizens to exercise in the morning and evening, significantly enhancing the quality of activity spaces. The enriched Dahu ecological floating island, after completion, has become a habitat for birds to forage and nest, providing a good place for fish to spawn, forage, and seek shelter. It also attracts many aquatic insects. Currently, it is common to see egrets and ducks nesting there. The earthen retaining wall on the west side of Dahu, which affected the lake's landscape, has been transformed using an ecological beautification method with wooden piles. The originally rigid concrete wall is now full of greenery. The connecting stair bridges between the various pools of Dahu often posed obstacles for strollers, wheelchairs, and elderly people visiting the park. After the barrier-free route was transformed, it is now unimpeded. The dense trees made the park dark and also bred mosquitoes, and the grass could not grow. Through appropriate pruning, thinning, and other transformation methods, sunlight now filters through the leaves, and the green grass under the trees is a beautiful sight, presenting the picturesque scenery of a sunny green space. The popular fishing activity among the public was also planned in the renovation project, and a comfortable fishing wooden platform was provided. It not only has comfortable wooden seats but also has nighttime lighting, allowing for fishing to be enjoyed to the fullest even at night. The second phase of the project focuses on the swimming pool construction. The original problematic structure of the swimming pool was rebuilt, and the transformed Dahu swimming pool will become an eco-friendly activity center in line with green building concepts. In terms of architectural appearance, a covered-earth landscape architecture was adopted. It not only does not create landscape pressure due to its large volume, but also fully integrates with the beautiful scenery of Dahu Park. At the same time, it can reduce radiant heat and achieve environmental protection and energy-saving effects. The roof is designed as an observation platform, allowing you to unconsciously ascend and take in the beautiful scenery of Dahu while strolling through the park. In addition, in consideration of the local microclimate environment such as sunlight and wind, clever design techniques such as sun-shading grids, window forms, and orientations were used to make the indoor swimming pool not only well-lit and comfortable in temperature, but also free of the disturbing smell of chlorine. The famous 50-meter long water channel pool will also be preserved, and the area around the pool will be properly greened and beautified. After the transformation, it will be fully integrated with the park landscape, and being in it will feel like swimming in nature. The first phase of the Dahu Park Environmental Transformation Project was completed on August 18, 2011, and has been open to the public. The second phase of the pool project started construction on February 20, 2012, and was completely finished in early 2014, meeting the public with a brand new look. We sincerely invite you to visit the park. In addition to getting away from the hustle and bustle, strolling through the park, walking along the willow-lined lakeside trail to enjoy the lake and mountain views, wandering in the bald cypress forest to absorb the essence of nature, and enjoying the fragrance of the grass, you can also engage in various activities such as fishing, picnicking, and swimming. If combined with nearby mountain hiking activities, Dahu Park will be the best resting place for half-day or one-day trips. Source: Park Streetlight Engineering Management Office."

  33: "Guandu, formerly known as Gandoumen, was an important port due to its strategic location between Guanyin Mountain and Datun Mountain, facing the Tamsui River. It played a significant role in early migration to northern Taiwan. Guandu's development started early, but declined as the river mouths of both Keelung River and Tamsui River gradually silted. Guandu boasts beautiful and precious riverside wetlands, with unique water plants rarely seen at the same latitude worldwide, making it a natural treasure. Guandu Ecological Park remains a prominent attraction to this day.",

  34: "Shezi Island is located at the confluence of the Keelung River and the Tamsui River. Its geological formation is characterized by sandy shoals. The area features extensive rice paddies and vegetable gardens, presenting a picturesque scene of rural life. A cycling path has been constructed along the embankment, attracting many cycling enthusiasts. At the sandbar of Shezi Island, one can witness the tumultuous convergence of the Keelung and Tamsui Rivers.

  35: "The Tianmu Ancient Trail and Qingshan Trail traverse the northwest slopes of Shilin Huagang, which is also the southern saddle of Mt. Shamao. These trails belong to the later section of the ancient Yurao Trail. Constructed along a major water pipeline, the trails lead through a serene and comfortable environment with the murmuring stream and pristine forest. The 'Cuifeng Trail' can also be accessed from the middle of the Tianmu Ancient Trail, leading to the Cui Feng Waterfall. Nestled in the mountainous woods, this trail offers a particularly cool and pleasant walk. The Tianmu Ancient Trail was once a crucial route between Jinshan and Tianmu. Since the opening of Yangde Boulevard, this early pathway has evolved into a genuinely recognized ancient trail. In recent years, it has risen in popularity as a hiking route, attracting hikers on holidays. The ecological landscape of the Tianmu Ancient Trail ranges from approximately 300 meters to 120 meters above sea level, belonging to the low-altitude subtropical broadleaf forest ecosystem of Taiwan. The northeast monsoon blowing from the Aoguanshan brings strong winds, rain, and low temperatures, creating a warm temperate broadleaf forest landscape on the windward side of the mountain. Conversely, the sheltered valley environment on the leeward side of the mountain is conducive to the growth of tropical broadleaf tree species, such as Ficus annulata, Schefflera octophylla, and bauhinias. Although the Tianmu Ancient Trail is only 300 meters above sea level, it possesses a compressed ecological environment encompassing tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate broadleaf forests, making it quite precious and unique."

It resembles the colonial architecture of the American South and served as the official residence for U.S. ambassadors such as Clarence E. Gauss, Walter P. McConaughy, and Karl L. Rankin. After the diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Taiwan were severed in 1979, the last ambassador left Taiwan, and the building was officially closed. After a period of vacancy, the building was designated as a third-class historic site by the Ministry of the Interior on February 20, 1997. It saw a new turn when the Taipei City Government commissioned the Taiwan Film and Culture Association to operate it as the 'Taipei House of Film,' focusing on film culture.

It is a branch of the Xing Tian Gong, which is a temple with a flourishing incense on Minquan East Road, Taipei City. However, its temple history is even earlier than the main temple in Taipei. The original names of both the Taiwan Railway 'Zhong Yi Station' and the current Taipei Metro 'Zhong Yi Station' were named after their proximity to 'Zhong Yi Temple'. The 'Guan Di Temple Xing Tian Gong', formerly known to believers as the 'Jiu Tai Street En Zhu Gong Temple', was originally located near today's Xin Xing Junior High School in Zhongshan District, Taipei City. The 'Guan Di Temple Xing Tian Gong' had a prosperous incense, but later, due to the temple site being designated for school use, the temple had to actively find a new location for relocation. As a result, in the 45th year of the Republic of China, a suitable temple site was found in the Shalao Bie area of Beitou (today's Zhong Yi Shan). The construction was funded and initiated by Master Xuan Kong of Xing Tian Gong, and it was completed and celebrated on May 31, 1965, displaying a grand three-hall temple layout. The Beitou Xing Tian Gong temple area covers approximately 8 hectares. The temple buildings are grand, and in addition to the attached library, the area is rich in flowers and trees, with abundant natural ecology. Facilities such as trails, garden landscapes, rest pavilions, parking lots, and public toilets are well-planned. It also serves as the starting point for the Zhong Yi Shan hiking trail planned by the city government. As you ascend the stairs from the foot of the mountain, the first thing that comes into view is a large expanse of green grass, garden landscapes, and coconut palm tree-lined pathways. Climbing further up through the Sun and Moon gates, you arrive at the spacious front hall of the Beitou Branch Temple. The temple courtyard is very spacious, with red walls and gray stone-slabbed ground creating a peaceful atmosphere under the blue sky. Passing through the mountain gate, you'll see the elegant Yu Huang Temple and Bell Tower and Drum Tower, showcasing the beauty of exquisite architecture. After paying respects at the Yu Huang Temple, rear hall, and San Yuan Hall, turning towards the back of the mountain, you can feel the tranquil beauty of nature even more. Strolling along the lush and secluded paths, looking up at the dense bamboo groves, or gazing at the weathered and extraordinary rock formations, you'll find the scenery even more serene. Furthermore, climbing the eight hundred steps on the right side offers a distant view of the Guandu Plain and Tamsui River, providing an expansive and comfortable vista, making it an ideal spot for a cycling trip or a refreshing outing along the Beitou Line.",

    40: "Located in the Botanical Garden, the Historical Museum exhibits a different temperament in its tranquil natural environment. The exterior belongs to Chinese palace architecture, with two-story pavilions and green roof eaves. Outside the museum, there are decorations of flowing water on small bridges, giving the feeling of being outside the city. The museum has a history of over 50 years and was originally mainly based on the collection of the Henan Museum. It gradually increased its collection and expanded its building to become the art and cultural relics collection and exhibition space recognized and valued by the art and education community today. Along the way, despite the hardships, it gradually grew to its present state. The museum displays donations from many private collectors, including pre-Qin cord-marked pottery, Han dynasty green-glazed pottery, Six Dynasties figurines for dancing and music, Tang Dynasty tricolored pottery, oracle bones, bronze objects, jade objects, porcelain, and documents, among other precious cultural relics.

In terms of art, it is a comprehensive museum focusing on objects with historical significance.",
    41: "Lengshuikeng Hot Springs are located in the eastern valley between Mt. Qixing and Mt. Mafeng (Seven Gourd Mountain). Originally, it was a standard explosion crater, but it was later eroded naturally and developed by human activity, leaving only an inconspicuous concave shape. The main rocks in the area are andesite breccia and purplish-brown hornblende andesite. Most of the rocks near the spring source have undergone alteration due to hydrothermal action, resulting in clay-like texture. The spring water gushing from the bottom of the cold spring is about 40 degrees Celsius, much lower than other hot spring areas, giving it its name. This is also the only sulfur deposition bed in Taiwan. The spring water appears milky white, earning it the name 'Milk Pool'. Lengshuikeng Hot Springs are indirectly heated by underground water, resulting in two different types of springs: neutral carbonate hydrogen carbonate springs and weakly acidic sulfate springs. The nearby Trickling Stream Waterfall and Dream Lake Ecological Conservation Area are also popular attractions. In this natural environment, you may often encounter friends from the natural world. Common sightings include the long-legged green frog, sharp-nosed green frog (which chirps like a bird and is known as the Swinhoes's Pseudoadhesive Frog), and the Pan Gu toad with numerous warts. There are also some snakes and reptiles. In addition to considering safety, out of respect for the environment, please do not disturb them."

It was Taiwan's first officially constructed public market and is currently the oldest intact third-class historical market building. Designed by Japanese architect Kondo Juro, the market's entrance is in the shape of a Bagua, signifying gathering from all directions. The main structure follows a cross-shaped design, making it a unique example in Eastern and Western architectural history. The Octagon and Cross buildings, along with the plazas to the north and south, collectively form 'Ximending Red House.' In November 2007, the Taipei City Government's Department of Cultural Affairs commissioned the Taipei Cultural Foundation to operate and manage the venue. Through hosting creative cultural activities, various areas within the Octagon building, such as the theater on the second floor, central exhibition area, bazaar, Ximending Red House Teahouse, Ximending Red House Boutique Area, and 16 studios in the Cross building, were revitalized. This transformation, alongside other initiatives, has turned it into a cultural and creative industry hub in the western district of Taipei. In 2008, it received the 'Historical Space Revitalization Award' at the 7th Taipei City Urban Landscape Awards. In 2009, Ximending Red House took over the 'Taipei City Film Theme Park' and planned the 'Urban Show Case' public art installation, creating a memory space for the city. It received the Gold Award in the 'Public Open Space' category in 2010. It also managed the 'Ximending Pedestrian Zone Street Performers,' extending artistic and cultural experiences. In 2009, over a thousand cultural and artistic events were held throughout the year, accumulating more than four million visitors. In 2010, the concept of nurturing creative brands was continued with the establishment of a cultural and creative industry development center in the Cross building.

Legend has it that after Mazu achieved immortality, she often rescued ships in distress at sea. In Taiwanese faith, she is a widely revered deity. The temple is a six-story square structure, with the main hall, Sanchuan Hall, exuding a solemn aura. The roof is adorned with sculptures of the Three Stars of Happiness, Prosperity, and Longevity, signifying blessings. The stone lions in the Sanchuan Hall date back to 1803. After being temporarily abandoned during renovations, they were later placed in front of the hall. They are considered treasures due to their traditional depiction of the male lion with an open mouth and the female lion with a closed mouth, a rarity in Taiwan. Besides stone carvings, the temple also features vibrant wooden carvings depicting flowers, animals, and figures, evoking a sense of grandeur. Ciyu Temple has always been the spiritual center for residents of Sikou's 13th Street.

  48: "Zhinan Temple is located at the foothills of Mount Zhinan in Wenshan District, Taipei City. Established in 1890 by Master Wang Binlin, the then Magistrate of Danshui, who invited the Sacred Mother from Fujian. Initially constructed with thatched roofs, it underwent meticulous planning, design, and extensive reconstruction to become what it is today. Zhinan Temple primarily enshrines the Pure Yang Ancestor LÃ¼ Dongbin, formally known as 'Fuyou Emperor,' but commonly referred to as Xian Gong or LÃ¼ Zu in folk culture. LÃ¼ Dongbin lived during the Tang Dynasty, excelling in literature and having attained the rank of Jinshi in the imperial examinations. He also served as a county magistrate. Due to his devout aspiration for Taoism, he encountered the True Yang Ancestor Zhongli Quan, who, through a dream, transformed ordinary stones into gold, imparted Taoist practices, and guided him on the path of enlightenment. LÃ¼ Dongbin eventually achieved Taoist immortality and attained a position among the ranks of the immortals. However, due to his grand aspiration of 'saving all sentient beings,' he often manifested himself in the mortal realm, displaying various miracles and leaving behind many heartwarming stories in Taiwanese folklore. He is the most beloved and familiar Taoist deity to the people of Taiwan. The temple compound covers a vast area, with ancient trees providing ample shade. The entire temple complex consists of four grand halls: Pure Yang Hall, Lingxiao Hall, Mahavira Hall, and Great Achievement Hall. All the main halls are built in harmony with the surrounding mountains, presenting an imposing and solemn atmosphere. The architecture predominantly employs robust blue stone, with some halls featuring copper roofs that can withstand the test of time.

  49: "What's red? Taiwan Beer is red! This is a very famous slogan. Taiwan's own Taiwan Beer Brewery is the Taipei Brewery, formerly known during the Japanese occupation period as 'Takasago Beer Company.' Established in 1919, it was the only beer manufacturing plant in Taiwan during the Japanese colonial era and was on par with the Sapporo Beer Factory in Hokkaido, Japan. After Taiwan's retrocession, it was taken over by the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau. Two years later, the Monopoly Bureau became the Taiwan Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Bureau, and the beer factory was renamed 'Taipei Beer Company' and later 'Taipei Second Brewery.' In 1975, it was officially named 'Jianguo Brewery.' It has now been in existence for nearly 90 years, bearing witness to the development of Taiwan's industry, culture, and brewing industry evolution. Jianguo Brewery holds high historical value, with its brewing tools and factory buildings serving as living relics rich in history. It is currently managed by the Taipei City Urban Development Bureau, which aims to transform the brewery into a beer culture park themed venue that incorporates dining, entertainment, culture, and tourism, allowing people to experience the joy of beer production.

During the Japanese colonial period, it served as the constructed Taipei Primary School. After Taiwan's retrocession, it became the office of the Taipei City Government. In 1994, when the Taipei City Government moved to the Xinyi Planning District, the main building of the city hall was repurposed as an art museum. The east and west wings of the building became a junior high school. The museum was originally named 'Taipei Second Museum of Fine Arts.' Later, the 'Taipei Fine Arts Museum' emerged as an independent entity, and in 2000, it was officially renamed 'Taipei Fine Arts Museum,' exhibiting various contemporary artworks.

It was built in 1937 and was originally the 'Taiwan Governor's Office Monopoly Bureau Songshan Tobacco Factory,' pioneering modern industrial plants in Taiwan and serving as the first professional cigarette factory. The architectural style is 'early modernism' with simple and elegant forms. It is considered a model factory of the time, featuring fine craftsmanship using bricks, tiles, and copper nails. After the war in 1945, it was taken over by the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau and renamed the 'Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau Songshan Tobacco Factory.' In 1998, due to factors such as urban space planning, public sales reform, and declining demand, it ceased production and merged into the Taipei Tobacco Factory, officially entering history. In 2001, the Taipei City Government designated it as the 99th city-designated historical site. The park is divided into: City-Designated Historical Site (Office Building, Warehouses 1-5, Tobacco Factory, Boiler Room), Historical Buildings (Inspection Room, Machinery Repair Shop, Childcare Room), and Special Buildings (Baroque Garden, Ecological Landscape Pool, Bathhouse, Multi-Functional Exhibition Hall). In recent years, to revitalize the park's space, it has collaborated with the Taiwan Design Center to set up the 'Taiwan Design Pavilion' and partnered with well-known domestic glass art studios to launch 'Xiaoshantang,' featuring glass art.

The decorative art of Dalongdong Baoan Temple, such as stone lions, dragon pillars, floral motifs, cut-and-paste decorations, clay sculptures, JiÄozhÇ ceramics, wood carvings, and painted murals, are treasures of artistry renowned far and wide, each possessing historical and artistic value. During the construction of Baoan Temple, two master craftsmen, Guo Ta and Chen Yingbin, were hired to divide the construction into two halves. Each created wood carvings, cut-and-paste decorations, clay sculptures, or JiÄozhÇ ceramics. This friendly competition was a popular trend at the time. Therefore, when appreciating the decorative art of Baoan Temple, one can simultaneously admire the works of different craftsmen on both sides.

  82: "The Zhinan Temple Maokong Mountain Trail consists of the Zhinan Temple Trail, the Dacheng Palace Trail, and the Tea Promotion Center Trail. This trail, centered around Zhinan Temple, is located on Monkey Mountain on the northwest side of the Erge Mountain Range. It is a must-pass route to Maokong, Zhanghu, and the Erge Mountain area. The Zhinan Temple Maokong Mountain Trail starts from Lane 33 of Section 3, Zhinan Road, ascending along stone steps. It passes through the Zhinan Temple Trail, Zhinan Temple, Lingxiao Precious Hall, Dacheng Palace, Dacheng Palace Trail, and Tea Promotion Center Trail, making it a family-friendly mountain hiking route. Zhinan Temple Trail: Along the Zhinan Temple Trail, there are elegantly styled stone lanterns lining both sides of the trail. From the archway at the entrance of the trail to the appearance of the first pavilion, 'Zhongnan Pavilion,' it's easy to discover the trail's construction during the Japanese Showa period. It features a rich Japanese architectural style, and it is very quaint and elegant, as well as precious. There are about 1200 stone steps on this trail, which can be quite a challenge for hikers who want to complete it in one go. Fortunately, the steps are spacious, and there are rest platforms every hundred steps or so, providing opportunities for hikers to take a break. Stone seats with elegant designs are placed next to ancient trees. Every segment of the trail features these unique views, as if there's 'only one in the world' near Taipei. Based on the inscription years on the stone lanterns, it's not hard to discover that this trail was constructed during the Showa period. No wonder the architectural style of the archway at the trail entrance and the first pavilion, 'Zhongnan Pavilion,' exudes a strong Japanese atmosphere. The large and majestic pavilion with stone steps crossing the trail exhibits the Baroque architectural style, representing the solid and unshakeable position of Zhinan Temple in the hearts of local residents. Enjoying the shade in the forest, there are many ferns, especially when approaching Zhinan Temple. The variety is abundant, often attracting many fern enthusiasts to visit more than 60 types of ferns. Forget Your Worries in the Valley: Similar to the Dacheng Palace Trail, the trail isn't very long, but the scenery along the way is rich. There are streams, terraced fields, and tea gardens along the way. During steep uphill sections, a broad platform offers a panoramic view of Zhinan Temple, nearby tea gardens, and lush bamboo forests. Along the trail segment that winds along the cliff, the route is especially interesting. When looking back, you can enjoy the pure countryside scenery with fields. The towering green mountains are so close, and the view is full of beauty, making it feel like a stroll in a fairytale. Approaching the 'Pot Hole' geological area, the forest starts to become denser. In the Maokong Valley area near the river, the forest becomes even denser. The riverbed has been eroded into uneven elliptical caves by swift currents, forming a unique geographical landscape. Legend has it that because these uneven oval caves resemble cat claw marks, over time, everyone started calling this place 'Maokong' (pronounced 'mao kong' in Taiwanese), meaning 'cat hole.' On the way to the Tea Promotion Center, there is a side trail that leads directly to the 'backyard' of certain tea houses. While lingering in the area, take a break in a tea house, savoring the lingering fragrance of Tieguanyin in your mouth. The excitement of the journey surges slowly in your heart. Yes, this is the taste of happiness!",
